  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='c007'>EARLY IN THE MORNING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was one o’clock on Christmas morning when the
Christmas sleigh returned to the Wesleyan Flats,
bringing Santa Claus and his two aides.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the three alighted, a man from the livery
stable, who had been engaged to meet them at that
hour, mounted the box to take the conveyance home;
but not before he had received a liberal gift.</p>

<p class='c009'>The house was all ablaze with light.</p>

<p class='c009'>There had been Christmas Eve festivals in almost
every suit of apartments in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merritt lifted little Owlet—so tired and so
sleepy, yet so divinely happy—and bore her into the
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Pollyon Syphax was on duty in the hall, and stared
at the three figures in the black waterproofs that covered
their disguises from head to foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>They went upon the elevator, reached Roma’s parlor
and found her reclining in her armchair by the
center table, reading the “Golden Legend” by the light
of a shaded lamp.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Nouvellini lay fast asleep in her invalid
chair, nor did she wake up on the entrance of the
party.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What sort of a time did you have?” inquired Roma,
as the weary Santa Claus sat down on the sofa with
the sleeping child across his knees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A very fine time. The ground, or rather the snow,
was so hard and smooth, and the horses so fresh, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>I am sure they got over the ground with more than
steam-engine express speed! Guided by our policeman,
I think we visited every poor neighborhood, and
even every criminal locality in the ten miles’ square.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was right; for there are innocent children
everywhere, even in the guiltiest haunts. Ah, poor
children! If I have lost Will Harcourt, I must devote
my life and all it holds to them! What am I saying?
Whether I have lost him or not, I will devote all that
I may of my life to the rescue of the lost children?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” inquired the lawyer. “Is your stout heart
failing that you talk of the possibility of losing Will
Harcourt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! I do hope—but ‘hope deferred maketh the
heart sick.’ No news comes,” sighed Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The young man may have been smuggled on board
some outbound ship—may be across the ocean by this
time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not exactly think so. I only throw out the
idea on speculation, as a possible explanation of the
failure of all our plans to discover him! Well, my
dear, I must be going now! It is twenty minutes past
one. I suppose the people in this house mean to keep
it up all night. To-morrow I shall come and give you
a report of to-night’s work—‘To-morrow?’ It is to-morrow
now!—Christmas is more than an hour old!”
said the lawyer, as he arose and carefully laid the
sleeping child on the sofa.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We made a great many people happy to-night, but
the happiest of all was little Owlet! There are children’s
parties in the mansions of the rich everywhere,
but I doubt if any among them enjoyed themselves as
little Owlet did to-night. She has gone to sleep, tired
out with a surfeit of happiness. Good-evening, my
dear,” he said, warmly pressing Roma’s hand. “Come,
boy!” he added, shaking up the dozing Tom, who, Virginia
negro fashion, had dropped himself down on the
floor and gone to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the two had left the room, Roma knelt down
by the sofa, and began to undress the child softly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>deftly, so as not to awaken her if it were possible to
avoid doing so.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merritt had already taken off her mask, and the
removal of her other disguises was comparatively
easy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But as Roma rolled her gently over, stealing, as it
were, her clothing off her, the child partly awoke, and
murmured in her sleep:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you dear little baby—here’s—a dolly for you,
and—candy and——” She dropped into deeper sleep
with the words on her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma put the child in her own bed. Then she looked
at Marguerite, and saw that she was sleeping well,
with ice water, milk and all else within reach that she
might want during the remainder of the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then at length Roma herself went to bed and to
sleep, and slept soundly, notwithstanding the loud revelry
that was going on over her head and under her
feet, and on the opposite side of the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Late as was the hour when she retired, she awoke
quite refreshed at her usual time—seven o’clock in the
morning. Her little bedfellow was still sound asleep,
living over in dreams the happiest ride and night she
had ever had in her little life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma covered the sleeping face with a thin handkerchief,
and then opened the windows to air the room
and passed into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her protégée, Marguerite Nouvellini, was not only
awake, but sitting up in her adjustable chair, with a
breakfast tray before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was so hungry when I woke up that I wheeled
myself in reach of the bell, and rang and ordered
breakfast. Did you care?” she inquired, seeing Roma’s
surprised look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, my dear,” Roma hastened to say; “though
if you had touched the timbre on your stand, you
would have waked me, and I could have done it all for
you and saved you the fatigue of pushing yourself
about the room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it did not tire me—not at all. Oh, this chair! I
don’t believe that even you, who bought it for me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>know half its merits. I said it was bed and chair and
carriage to me. It is more than that. It is legs! I
can go where I please about the room with just the
lightest little push on this little knob. See!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the invalid wheeled herself around the room
and back again to her stand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see,” said Roma; “it works easily, and you are so
much stronger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ever so much stronger and better. I shall soon
get well now. Thanks to you, dear friend. But I
should never have got better if you had not brought
me out of that miserable room, where the only choice
I had was between sitting in the bitter cold or having
a smoking fire in the wretched little iron stove, and
I think the smoke was worse than the cold. And then
that straight-backed little chair! And the diet of
bread and tea, that was always cold before it reached
me! Ah, I was dying of discomfort more than of a
cough when you found and rescued me. And now, in
this lovely room, in this lovely chair, and with the
clean, soft steam heat, and all the good things you
give me to eat day and night, and, above all, you yourself!
You are always breathing the breath of life over
me—if it is not a sin to say it. And I shall soon be
well and strong. And, oh! may the Lord open some
way for me to show my love and gratitude to you! I
have not talked so much as this since the day I was
taken down sick,” she concluded, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear, you have not, nor do I think it wise in you
to tax your strength in doing so now,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the invalid was in a talking mood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I woke up this morning, the first thing I
saw was Owlet’s mask and dress, and I knew she had
got home safe,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! and she was in bed long before several
other children of the house who were dancing; and
Mr. Merritt thinks she was happier than them all,”
said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>While they talked together, little Owlet suddenly
appeared before them, ready dressed for breakfast.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>She had risen in her quiet way and made her simple
toilet silently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Roma produced her Christmas presents, a
lovely wadded silk dressing gown for Madame Marguerite,
and a workbox, completely fitted, for Owlet.
Both were delighted, and declared—what all people
declare to the giver of Christmas gifts—that the present
was just exactly what the receiver most wanted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad you didn’t give me a doll,” said Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?” inquired Roma, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like dolls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because they are not alive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! But neither are workboxes alive,” said Roma,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But workboxes don’t look as if they are alive, and
dolls do. Besides, workboxes are so useful, and dolls
are of no use on the face of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not to play with?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. Who wants to play with a thing that looks
like it ought to be alive, and ain’t?” inquired this solemn
little monster.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, all the little girls I ever saw loved to play
with dolls,” said Roma, much amused by the oddity
of the “type” before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then if they do, I think they are not possessed of
common sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are certainly a fairy changeling. You can’t
be a human child,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know about that. I don’t remember what
I was at first. I only remember being Madame Marguerite’s
little girl. And now I am going upstairs to
go to the bottom of mamma’s big trunk and get my
Christmas present for you,” said Owlet; and away she
sped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her mother called her back, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring the little red morocco case down with you,
too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With papa’s picture?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, with papa’s picture.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The child flew away, and after a little space returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>with the miniature case in one hand and a
small casket in the other. She thrust the case into
her mother’s hand and then ran eagerly to Roma,
opened the little casket, and displayed a simple little
necklace of turquoise beads.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is for you. Oh! try it around your throat.
Please do. It will look so lovely on your white
throat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma kissed the child, took the necklace, and
clasped it around her neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! It just suits you! Don’t it? It is blue,
like your eyes. But your eyes are darker. Mamma
said I might give you this,” said Owlet in delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, Madame Marguerite was opening the
little case.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here,” she said, “I want you to look at the picture
of my husband. See how handsome he was!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma took the miniature, which was in the form
of a locket, and set around with a circle of pearls of
the purest quality.</p>

<p class='c009'>But as soon as her eyes fell upon the pictured face
it took all her great self-control to keep still.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he not handsome?” inquired Madame Marguerite.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Many people might think so,” answered Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you think so?” asked the widow, with a little
tone of disappointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am a blonde, which is, perhaps, the reason why
I do not much admire fair men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This was your husband, you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was his name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guilliaume Nouvellini.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Frenchman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. There’s where I got my French name, for I
am not a French woman, though I did dance at the
Theatre Française and the Gaieté.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How long ago did he marry you?” inquired Roma,
with consummate self-command.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Six years ago this New Year. And we were very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>happy for about another year. Then he died, when
little Owlet was but three months old. Well, all that
is past and gone these five years ago. One must not
dwell on one’s past sorrows if one means to live and
work in this world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon me for asking so many questions, but I
feel very deeply interested in this matter,” said Roma,
as she gazed on the miniature. “But—was your husband
with you when he died?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, me! No. I was in Paris with my young babe.
He had to go to San Francisco on some very pressing
business, I know not what, and there he was taken ill
of some fatal fever. He wrote me several letters while
he was on his sick bed. Then at last came a letter
from his physician, announcing his death, and a newspaper
with his obituary in it. Ah, me! It was a great
sorrow, but one must not dwell on their own sorrows
if they want to be of any use in this world. I did not
have that locket brought down here merely to show
you my poor husband’s handsome face, but to do this.
Please let me have the locket again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma put it in her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>She touched a little spring, took the miniature out
of the jeweled locket, and put the latter in Roma’s
hand, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you to have these pearls, dear. You see,
they are very fine, else I would not offer them. Do
take them, dear. They are all I have to give you.
Get them reset in a brooch, and wear it sometimes
for my sake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma took the pearls, and kissed the forehead of
the donor with tears in her own eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Madame Marguerite was pressing the dis-set
picture to her lips and to her heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are we going to have any breakfast to-day, ma’am?
You and I, I mean. My stomach has gone to my backbone,”
said Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, my dear; we will go down,” replied Roma,
who, since she had had an invalid domiciled in her
parlor, and a little companion to accompany her to
the restaurant, always went there for meals.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Now we will see what they will give us for a
Christmas breakfast,” said Owlet as she entered the
elevator.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would you like?” inquired Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Milk, real milk, not milk and water; cake and preserved
strawberries.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A rather bilious bill of fare, Owlet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, I won’t eat it; and mind you don’t,
either! A person ought not to eat anything to make
them sick; any person who does that is not possessed
of common sense,” said Owlet authoritatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you are quite right, ma’am,” said Roma,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What makes you always call me ma’am? I’m not
a married woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you are not!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, of course not. I’m not even engaged. You
know I’m not. So what makes you call me ma’am?”
demanded Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Roma, slowly and thoughtfully, “in
high courtesy, ladies of distinction, married or unmarried,
are, or used to be, always addressed as ‘madam’
or ‘ma’am.’ Now I think a young personage like yourself,
who is too wise to hear a fairy tale because you
say it is not true—though it may be, for aught you
know—or to play with a doll because it is not alive—though
they may also be in some sense—ought certainly
to be honored with the title of madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet gazed at the lady in solemn and sorrowful
wonder and disapprobation, and then she gave utterance
to her feelings:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If anybody else in this world but you was to talk
like that I know what I should think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what?” inquired the amused lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They were not possessed of common sense,” said
Owlet gloomily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very few people are so happily endowed according
to your standard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The elevator came down, with a little jar, to the
basement floor, and Roma led her small friend out
into the hall and through to the restaurant.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“We are not mad with each other, are we?” inquired
Owlet as they seated themselves at one of the
remote corner tables.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, certainly not! We are the best of friends
always.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad of that, because I only told the truth, and
it was for your good, too; because I do love you,
really.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The breakfast bill of fare laid before them by the
obsequious waiter arrested attention and stopped the
conversation; and after the meal was served Owlet
was too much engaged with her milk, bread and eggs
to favor Roma with any more “wisdom in solid
chunks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When they returned to the parlor upstairs they
found Mr. Merritt there, waiting for Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any news of Will Harcourt?” she inquired as she
shook hands with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“None whatever. We must do now what we should
have done in the beginning—advertise for him,” replied
the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean in the personal columns of the daily
papers and by initials and guarded hints?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I mean by a straightforward advertisement
in the advertising columns for information respecting
the whereabouts of William Everard Harcourt, late
of Lone Lodge, West Virginia, who left his home on
the Isle of Storms, coast of Maryland, on the fifteenth
of last November, and has not been heard from since,
and offering a large reward for intelligence that shall
lead to the discovery of his fate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will be making his mysterious disappearance
very public.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but it is absolutely the only hope left of finding
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if this advertisement should come to the
knowledge of his poor mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear lady, Dorothy Harcourt, by all accounts,
is not in a mental condition to appreciate it. She
thinks her son is at his college. She has forgotten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>all recent events—that is, if we may credit the report
of Miss Wynthrop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know. Well, since it is so absolutely necessary
you may insert the advertisement in all the
papers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear child, there is another matter on
which I wish to speak to you. You, who were a very
queen of society, why do you seclude yourself from
the world here in the midst of Washington City in
the height of the fashionable season? Why do you
not send your cards to your friends who are present
here, and would be so glad to invite you to their
parties.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. Merritt, how can I, under present circumstances?
I have no wish to go out. Although I have
done no wrong, I feel as if I were a social pariah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is morbid—very morbid! The story of your
wrongs is not known at all beyond the precincts of
the judicial chambers; and even if it were known, it
would only invest you with a deeper interest, that
would hold much admiration and no censure whatever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I could not tolerate such a personal interest, Mr.
Merritt,” replied Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, my dear, if you will make a hermit of yourself,
would not your country house be a more attractive
abode than a suit of apartments in a crowded
flat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! you are anxious to get rid of me, Mr. Merritt,”
said Roma archly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know better than that; but the truth is, I
am off for San Francisco, on sudden and imperative
business, and must go by the early train to-morrow
morning, and I hate to leave you here alone. If you
will not go out I would much rather know that you
were with your old neighbors at Goblin Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma glanced at Madame Marguerite, whose chair
had been wheeled to one of the back windows, through
which she was looking out upon the little piece of
woods left standing at some little distance from the
house. She seemed absorbed in thought, and gazing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>rather on vacancy than on the limited landscape before
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I see—I see,” sighed the lawyer. “You are
making yourself a martyr to that poor little soul!
Why not send her to the Providence Hospital?” he
inquired, lowering his voice to a tone inaudible to any
ears beyond Roma’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because it would break her heart. Besides, when
I ‘introspect’—to use your own words, Mr. Merritt—I
find that it gives me so much happiness to make
her comfortable that there is no merit at all in my
serving her; and, of course, not the least suggestion
of self-sacrifice,” replied Roma in the same low key.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well, my dear, as you will. I am going to
church at St. John’s for the Christmas service. You,
I suppose, cannot leave your invalid. Good-morning.
Shall see you again before I leave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma’s dream for her protégée was to take her to
Goblin Hall as soon as the spring should open, if the
invalid should be well enough to bear the journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>The daily improvement warranted the hope. So
did the words and manners of the attending physician.
It is the religion of the medical doctor to inspire
hope in his patient and his patient’s friends,
whether there be any reasonable grounds for it or
not. It is one of his methods of cure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marguerite grew so much better that she could
walk from room to room.</p>

<p class='c009'>This improvement continued for weeks, and the invalid,
who never had lost her spirits, even in her worst
days, grew buoyant with anticipation of her summer
holiday in the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall like your Goblin Hall,” she said; “and I
know it must be haunted. I dote on a haunted house,
though I never was in one in my life. I do believe in
ghosts, and I don’t believe one word about the name
being rightly Goeberlin Hall. I believe it is really and
truly Goblin Hall, so called on account of its ghost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it has a ghost and a haunted room,” said Roma
very gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, I said so!” exclaimed Marguerite.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“And you shall occupy it, if you wish to do so,”
added Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, thank you. I don’t want to do that. I
only want to feel that there is such a room in the old
colonial house, and, when other people are with me in
the evening, to hear the ghostly footsteps and voices
in the distance. But I don’t want to be near them
and away from everybody else. Oh, no,” said Marguerite,
laughing and shaking her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet looked and listened in solemn disapproval.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think about it, ma’am?” inquired
Roma, to draw the child out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like to say,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but I insist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, if Tom had talked that way I should
think Tom was not possessed of common sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” exclaimed Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t mind her,” pleaded Marguerite. “She don’t
know any better. She is such a strange child. Her
mind is not right. I do think she is half an idiot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, indeed, she is not. But where did she pick
up that phrase she is so often repeating?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lord knows. I don’t. She has had such a
strange life for a child. She has never had any other
children to play with—never! nor any permanent
nurse; but has been changed from hand to hand as
I have traveled from country to country. Don’t mind
the poor little devil—I beg pardon. But she is half
an idiot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet fixed the speaker with her large, solemn
brown eyes, but made no remark, nor did Roma; for
at that instant Mr. Merritt was announced. He had
just returned from his Californian trip, and his first
call was upon Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear, have you had any news?” he inquired
after he had shaken hands with all in the
room and had taken a seat, and Marguerite had been
wheeled into the adjoining chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not one word. I begin to credit a suggestion that
you once made me—that Will Harcourt has crossed
the ocean,” Roma replied.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Then I will cause advertisements to be inserted
in all the leading papers in the capital cities of
Europe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have already done so, and am waiting results.
I have another source of anxiety. I have not heard
from Mrs. Harcourt since you left, and you know the
reason why I cannot write to inquire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I will do so to-day. Hanson has not shown
up in any way, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I have seen no notice of him or his yacht
since that one we both read late in November. Pray,
dear friend, never mention the creature’s name in
my presence again. I wish to forget his existence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His sister, your old schoolmate and bosom friend.
She was a fine girl. What of her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was not his sister, nor even his half-sister,
thank heaven! He was only the stepson of her stepfather
by a former marriage. Reba is traveling in
Europe, and our correspondence happily suspended
without any painful explanations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is well. And now, my dear, I must leave
you, as I have a very busy day before me,” said the
lawyer as he shook hands with her and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Four days later he brought a letter from Miss Wynthrop,
saying that Mrs. Harcourt’s condition was unchanged,
and that her mind was principally occupied
with anticipations of seeing her dear son, who, as she
told everybody, was pursuing his law studies in the
University of Virginia, but would come and spend his
Easter holidays with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Evidently she has forgotten all about the marriage
at which she was present, and apparently all about
my existence. That may be well. But if she had only
forgotten the marriage, and not forgotten me, I might
still write to her, still comfort her, as the betrothed
of her son,” said Roma with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wrote another letter by the same mail by which
I wrote to Miss Wynthrop. The second letter was to
Dr. Wall, the Logwood practitioner, who is attending
Mrs. Harcourt, to inquire into her condition. In reply,
he informs me that she is affected with softening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of the brain, that there is no hope of her recovery,
though she may live for many years. It is very sad!
Sadder than death!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” sighed Roma. “Oh, if I could only go to her,
or have her with me! Ah! Where is her son?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer sighed, and shook his head in hopeless
helplessness, and soon after rose and took leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>The early days of the New Year were very fine, but
toward the middle of January the weather changed.
A cold wave swept over the city, bringing fierce snowstorms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Marguerite felt the change, and began to
cough, and complain of oppression on her chest, with
fever. Her attendant physician treated her for these
symptoms, and Roma nursed her tenderly.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, as if the severe weather was not sufficiently
injurious, something went wrong with the great furnace,
or the pipes, it was difficult to tell which, and
the rooms were imperfectly heated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marguerite shivered and flushed or broke into heavy
perspirations.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was too ill to be removed from the house, but
Roma did all that was possible to make her comfortable.
She wheeled her reclining chair up against the
steam pipes on the wall and stretched a screen around
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>One morning a crisis came. Marguerite was seized
with a severe fit of coughing, which resulted in hemorrhage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma held the bowl and supported the fragile form
until the flow ceased. Then she laid the sufferer back
on the reclining chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—that—was—good,” murmured Marguerite,
very faintly; “that—was—relief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And though she was very weak, weak almost unto
death, she seemed to suffer less from oppression and
difficulty of breathing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma administered a restorative, and told her not
to speak or move again for some time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Roma looked at Owlet, who was sitting very
still on the other side of the chair, holding her mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>hand and looking up into Roma’s face with large,
solemn eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not be distressed, my dear. It is over now,”
the lady said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’m not. It does her good. She says it does.
She had it once before, and it did her good. She said
it did. Only she is so weak after it,” the child replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>It required all Roma’s self-command to keep up a
cheerful countenance. She knew better than the
child, of course, and even better than the child’s mother,
what these hemorrhages meant, and what the relief
they brought suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this time forward she was, if possible, even
more careful, more attentive and more tender to the
sufferer than ever before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marguerite was extremely weak in body, but not
the least depressed in mind. She talked only of recovery
and of going to the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel so light,” she said, “since I got relieved of
all that bad blood that oppressed my chest. I shall
get well now. This is only the last of January, and I
shall have plenty of time to get well and strong before
the first of April. And, oh, my little idiot will see
the flowers burst into bloom! Do you know she was
never in the country in her life, and never saw a
growing rosebush, except in a pot?” So she would
talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>And as a season of mild weather ensued, she grew
better, and under skillful medical treatment and tender
nursing and good feeding continued to improve
every day until the severe cold and high winds of
early March came. Then she took cold again, no one
knew how; began to cough and complain of oppression,
suffocation and fever. Yet her spirits never flagged,
nor did she once think of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is only another cold,” she said to Roma, “but
when this month is past then will come the lovely
spring, and I shall be well, and go to the country. You
are going on the first of April, are you not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear, if you should be well enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I shall be well enough, never fear.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>One day, when the doctor had made his usual morning
visit, he made a slight sign to Roma that he
wished to speak to her alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>So when he had taken leave of his patient Roma
followed him into the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is my duty to tell you,” he said, “that our poor
young patient will not probably live out this month.
If she has any friends or relatives, they should be
informed of her condition. Try to ascertain the facts
without alarming her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I will,” replied Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>And after the doctor had left her she stood revolving
in her mind how she should proceed. She soon
made up her mind, and re-entered the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marguerite herself led the way up to the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a lovely day for the middle of March,” she
said faintly, as she usually now spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, a very lovely day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the weather keeps on like this we might soon
go to Goblin Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear. And the Hall is such a great, roomy
house that I wish I could fill it up with visitors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no; only you and me and my poor little fool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not mean strangers, dear, but friends. Now,
have you no friends or relations that you would like
to have with you? I could easily invite them to come
and visit you there; and it would be so pleasant, not
only for you and for them, but, most of all, for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How good you are! Oh! you are an angel! But,
no, I have no one in the whole world belonging to
me, that I know of, except my grandmother, old
Madam Arbuthnot, of Arbuthnot, in Scotland; and
she never saw me, nor I her. She must be over seventy
years old now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is it that you never saw her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she cast my mother off for marrying an actor.
My mother was her only child, and she cast her off
for marrying my father, who was a play actor, because,
you see, she was not only of a very high family,
and very proud of her descent, but she was a member
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of the Church of Scotland, and very strict in her
religion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” said Roma, revolving some curious questions
in her own mind, but giving them no utterance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My father and mother both fell into poverty, somehow
or other, I never knew how, and from the time
I was seven years old, and learned to dance on the
stage, supported them until they died, when I was
sixteen; then I went to Paris, and danced for myself
until I married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, do not talk any more just at present. You
are tired,” said Roma; and she went and brought the
invalid a glass of milk punch, which the latter drank
with the avidity with which she took all nourishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few days later Roma obtained from her protégée
the full address of Madam Arbuthnot, to be used in
case of necessity.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Madame Griselda Margaret Arbuthnot, Arbuthnot
Castle, Killharrt, Caithness, Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another severely cold spell, with high winds and
driving snow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marguerite grew much worse. She could no longer
lie down, or even recline, but sat straight up in her
chair, propped and supported on all sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>She suffered extremely from oppression, fever and
suffocation, but still her spirits never fell. She never
thought of death. She spoke, when she was able to
speak, only of getting well and of going to the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>One bright morning, near the end of March, she
had her chair wheeled to the windows, where she
could look out and see the piece of woods behind the
house, and watch the first softening and swelling of
the twigs of the trees before they began to burst into
leaflets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how I shall enjoy the country!” she said, and
then a terrible fit of coughing seized her. Roma hurried
to her side, and not a minute too soon. The red
stream of blood burst from her lips and poured into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the bowl that the lady held, until the pale sufferer
sank back again on her chair, murmuring faintly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!—that—was—such—relief. I am—ever—so
much—better now”—and died.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was so sudden at the last—so awfully sudden—that
even strong Roma was stupefied by the event,
and could not realize it. She set the sanguine bowl
on the table and gazed at the dead form. She was
aroused by the low voice of Owlet, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma is better now. She is always better after
one of these. It is bad to look at, but it makes her
better; she always says so. She is better, really, now,
is she not?” pleaded the child, looking in doubt at the
changed features of her mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my darling, she is better now,” said Roma
in a broken voice as she took the hand of Owlet to
lead her away.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the child was now gazing in terror at the face
of death. She snatched her hand from Roma’s clasp
and flung herself upon the dead bosom, crying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma! mamma! Oh, mamma! What is the matter
now? What makes you look so? Oh, ma’am, what
is the matter with my mamma? Why don’t she speak
to me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma lifted the child in her arms, sat down on the
sofa, held her to her heart, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your mamma is better, my darling—better than
she ever was in all her life before. God has taken her
now, and made her well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, He hasn’t! There she is, and something awful
is the matter with her! Oh! let me go to my poor
mamma!” sobbed the child, struggling to get out of
the arms of her friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma would not coerce her; she let her go. And
Owlet rushed back to the side of the dead, and began
to kiss and hug and cry and call, without meeting any
response.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! why don’t she answer? Oh! why don’t my
own mamma speak to me?” wailed the child, looking
up to her friend for an explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“She does not answer you, my child, because she is
not here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, there she is!” cried Owlet, pointing with
tearful persistence to the lifeless form in the chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, darling, that is not your mamma. If it were,
she would answer and caress you; but it is only the
body she lived in when she was with us. But the body
was poor and weak and sick and suffering, and the
Lord drew her out of it and took her to a better place.
Listen, darling. Your mamma is alive and well now.
She is not sick any more. If my body was to be weak
and sick, and more torment to me than use to anybody,
the Lord would take me out of it to a better
place, and make me well. Our bodies are not ourselves—they
are only the things we live in; they are
no more ourselves than our gloves are our hands, or
our shoes are our feet. Do you understand, dear?
Your mamma is not here in that body; she is well and
happy in a better place. You understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, but I want my mamma. Oh, I want my
own mamma!” the child wailed, and would not be
comforted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma held her again in her arms, and kissed and
embraced her, and wished with all her heart that
some one would come into the room. Some one presently
came.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the doctor, on his daily visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is all over,” she said in a low tone as she pointed
to the dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As I have been expecting to find it daily for the
last week,” the physician replied. Then:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How long since?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About half an hour, doctor. I am here alone with
this child, and cannot leave her. Will you kindly see
the proper people and send them here for the last
offices? Some woman, of course, must be on hand.
Please, also, see Mrs. Brown, our janitress. I must
engage a large room on this flat. There are plenty
of vacant rooms in the house now, since the exodus
of the fourth of March. Will you kindly attend to
these matters?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Willingly, my dear child,” said Roma’s old friend,
who then took a clean towel from a rack, spread it
over the dead face, and left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet sobbed herself to sleep on Roma’s bosom, and
then the lady tenderly lifted her, bore her into the
adjoining chamber, and laid her on the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour later an undertaker and his assistants
came to the room, introduced by Mrs. Brown herself,
who was really full of sympathy and helpfulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>A large front room, on the same floor, was prepared,
and there the body of Margaret Nouvellini was laid
out to await the day of the funeral, which was set for
the following Friday.</p>

<p class='c009'>Late in the afternoon, Roma, leaving the child
asleep on her bed, and leaving her hired assistants to
air her rooms and set them in order, went down to
the restaurant to get the cup of tea she so much
needed.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she returned to the upper floor she thought
she would look into the chamber of death to see that
all was done decently and in order.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a large front corner room, with high windows,
whose sashes were up and Venetian blinds
closed. The heat had been turned off, and the room
was intensely cold, as well as half dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>She discerned the white-sheeted form on the table,
in the middle of the floor, and there also, to her surprise
and sorrow, she saw little Owlet, who had drawn
a chair to the side of the bier, and climbed upon it,
and was resting head and arms upon her mother’s cold
body.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Catherine, darling! darling! don’t stay here in the
cold. It is not right, dear. Let me take you away and
get you something to eat,” said Roma, gently taking
hold of the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! Please don’t touch me! I don’t mind the
cold. I don’t want anything to eat! I want to stay
here with my mamma—my own mamma!” Owlet
pleaded, struggling to retain her place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under any other circumstances but that of the intense
cold of the room, Roma would have let the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>have her way; but now she gently expostulated with
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has turned bitterly cold within the last few
hours, darling, and the heat is turned off the room,
and all the windows are open, and you will be sick
if you stay here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mind being cold or sick! I want to stay
here with mamma, poor mamma—my own dear
mamma!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, love, your mamma is not here; she is well and
happy in a better place. But you will make her unhappy
if you stay here in the cold by the body that
she has left, and make yourself ill. Cannot you understand
that, Catherine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I know! I know!” gasped and sobbed the
child. “I know, but I can’t help it! I can’t help it!
I am not possessed of common sense myself now!
But I can’t help it! You may take me!” she cried,
holding out her arms to the lady, who lifted her,
pressed her to her bosom, and bore her away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three days later, on Friday afternoon, the mortal
remains of Marguerite Nouvellini, followed only by
the officiating clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Martin; Roma,
little Catherine, the lawyer and the physician, were
borne to their last resting place at Oak Hill Cemetery,
where, in the little Gothic chapel, the religious services
were held, and Roma took the orphan home to
her own heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the party returned to the house Roma
requested her two old friends, Lawyer Merritt and
Dr. Mix, to enter with her, as she wished to consult
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They accompanied her to the parlor of her flat,
where she sat down, with little Catherine on her lap,
and begged them to be seated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish to adopt this child as my own, unless some
one who has a better right should claim her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no!” here broke in little Catherine, clinging
closely to her protectress. “No! no! no! No one but
you! you! you!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Roma pressed the child to her bosom and continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“At least, I shall keep her for the present, and until
some one with a better right shall claim her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! no! no!” again protested the child. “No one
but you shall have me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Roma soothed her, and then resumed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What I wished to consult you about is this: There
is a large, packed Saratoga trunk upstairs that belonged
to this child’s mother. Should I go through
that trunk to obtain from it any papers that may be
there—information concerning the child’s relatives—or
should I put a seal upon the trunk and leave it
intact until it is claimed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say,” said the lawyer, “that you had better
search first, and seal it afterward, if necessary. If
the little one had any inheritance the Orphans’ Court
might appoint you her guardian and trustee; but as
she seems to have nothing—but the trunk—I do not
think it would be worth while to go through the formality.
Since you are determined to adopt the little
one, just act by her and her small effects as if she
were your own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I agree with you,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! I give myself to you! you! you! and to no
one else!” passionately exclaimed little Catherine,
clinging to her protectress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then, darling; I will keep you. Do not
be afraid,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then turning to the lawyer, she added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ought to tell you, perhaps, that the child has,
or had, a great-grandmother, a Madam Arbuthnot, of
Arbuthnot, in the Highlands of Scotland—a woman
of rank, who discarded this child’s grandmother more
than thirty years ago, since when there seems to have
been no communication at all. The old lady, if living,
must be nearly eighty, I should think. Under the
circumstances, ought I to write to her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” answered the two gentlemen simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the doctor arose and took leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the lawyer lingered.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“I have something to tell you,” he said. “I could
not tell before. It is good news, my dear Roma.
William Harcourt is found.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c007'>A MAN OF WOE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>To return to Will Harcourt, and that fifteenth of
November, when, at midnight, he disappeared from
the Isle of Storms.</p>

<p class='c009'>The earth was as heavily burdened with sorrow that
night as all nights. There were men and women and
children starving, freezing, perishing, in garrets, in
cellars, and in the streets; there were men and women
and children watching the dying faces of their best
beloved; there were human beings languishing in prisons,
hospitals, lunatic asylums; there were criminals
in condemned cells, waiting the execution of their
death sentence; but perhaps the most miserable being
on the face of the burdened earth on that fifteenth
of November was Will Harcourt, as he turned away
from the face of his beloved and confiding Roma and
walked with his Evil Genius down to the water side
to take the boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>He spoke no word after leaving the house, but
walked moodily, with his head hanging upon his
breast and his arms down by his sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson perceived his deep despair, and even his
selfish heart was touched.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brace up, man! brace up!” he cried, clapping Harcourt
heartily on the shoulder, as they passed through
the stubble field on their way down to the boat. “You
have lost Roma, to be sure, but you are not the first
man ever disappointed in love; and this wisdom of
the ages declares that ‘there are as good fish in the
sea as ever were caught out of it.’ You are very
young yet. You will be in love, or fancy yourself in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>love, with a score of women yet before you are fit to
marry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt replied never a word, but walked on like
a condemned prisoner before his executioner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come! Pull yourself together! You have lost
Roma, to be sure; but just consider what you have
saved, man—your life, your liberty, your good name,
your future, your ambition, your proud career, your
aged mother’s life and peace of mind, your betrothed
bride’s honor and reputation—all these that you have
saved by one sacrifice, you would have lost, had you
been proved a swindler, a sneak thief and a murderer.
Be wise, and reflect on the things you have saved,
not on the girl you have lost, and who, after your
deed, must have been lost to you in any case.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still Harcourt did not speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>They went down to the sands, where the boat was
waiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by! Bon voyage!” cried Hanson, gayly lifting
his hat as Harcourt went slowly, mechanically
into the boat and dropped upon his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The men, without a word, laid themselves to their
oars and rowed rapidly to the steamer that lay waiting
off the coast.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was already getting up steam, and as soon as
the men and passenger boarded her, and the boat
was hauled up, she started on her southern course.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no one on deck but the pilot, the watch,
and the one passenger who had just come on board.
All the rest, even the boat’s crew, had turned in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt sat in the stern of the steamer, with his
eyes fixed on the dark water beneath.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wrench of his parting with Roma lacerated his
heart; the thought of his treachery toward her tortured
his conscience. Was there a criminal on earth
so black as he? Was there a soul in hell so miserable?</p>

<p class='c009'>What would Roma think of him when she should
come to know his deed? Truly “a deed without a
name,” that no law had ever forbidden, because no
man or devil had ever dreamed of it!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>He loathed himself and his life as he loathed death
and putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>And yet it seemed to him that all he had done and
all he had suffered was the work of unforeseen, irresistible
destiny. He had never intended to do wrong.
He had never thought it possible for him to commit
one dishonorable act. He had aspired to live a perfectly
upright and honorable life; to be a credit to
the aged and widowed mother who had lost all on
earth but him, and whose hopes in age and sorrow
were centered on him; to be worthy of the noble girl
who had given him her priceless heart, in his poverty
and privation.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had labored and suffered to gain an education
and a profession; he had denied himself not only all
the pleasures of youth, but all the comforts of life;
he had worn himself out with toil and want to this
end!</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he had gone to the Isle of Storms as hotel
clerk, not only to get up his strength in the bracing
sea air and better living of the seaside resort, but to
earn money enough to pay for his last college course.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah! If he could have foreseen the end of his fatal
sojourn there!</p>

<p class='c009'>He was lured into the downward path without seeing
whither he was going. He was expected to be
polite and obliging to the guests of the house, and
he was willing and anxious to be so.</p>

<p class='c009'>When his office duties were not pressing he was
expected to join in any amusement in which he might
assist, and he was delighted to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>For courtesy, he would take a hand at a game of
cards where one was wanted to make up a party; for
courtesy, he would take a glass of champagne when
invited to do so, and he never dreamed of danger until
destruction overtook him; never dreamed of wrong
or danger until that fatal night in September when
he fell into the trap of a professional gambler, and
played and drank and drank and played, and drank
again, until he lost his reason, and staked money that
was not his own, and lost it to the gambler, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>been scheming for that very sum from first to last of
the game.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was not that destiny? Forewritten, unforeseen, irresistible
destiny?</p>

<p class='c009'>So it seemed to the wretched youth, as, leaning over
the steamer’s side, gazing into the dark water of the
bay, he reviewed the story.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then he remembered his vain pleadings, with
groans and tears, to the obdurate gamester to return
the embezzled money, if not as a restitution, then
as a loan, to be repaid with usurious interest, if it
took the loser’s whole life to do it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, when all his prayers had been denied and
derided, and the swindler had left him alone with his
anguish and despair, came the mad desperation that
seized him, and fired him with the thought that it
would be right to try the only means in his power
to recover the embezzled money—to take his pass-key
and go to the swindler’s room in the dead of the night,
and withdraw the stolen sum from the thief’s possession.
And he recalled how he went on this perilous
venture, and succeeded in getting back the money,
when a slight noise caused him to look around, and
he saw the gambler sitting up in bed and leveling a
pistol at his head; how instinctively he sprang upon
the would-be murderer and seized and turned his
hand; how the pistol went off and shot the gambler
dead!</p>

<p class='c009'>Was not this destiny? Forewritten, unforeseen,
irresistible destiny? So it seemed now to poor Harcourt
in his unutterable misery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then passed before his mental vision his swift, instinctive
action of closing up the room within and
escaping through the window, which shut with a
spring; the night alarm; the breaking into the room;
the discovery of the dead man, with his brains blown
out, and the discharged pistol in his stiffened hand;
circumstantial evidence that convinced the spectators
then, and the coroner’s jury afterward, that the
death of Yelverton had been suicide. And then, when
all seemed over, and the secret of that tragedy buried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>in the conscience-stricken soul of Harcourt only, came
the accusation from the hidden witness, Hanson, who
had seen the whole drama through a knothole in a
wooden partition that divided his room from Yelverton’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was not this destiny? Forewritten, unforeseen, irresistible
destiny? So it seemed to the doomed youth
who reviewed the story.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Hanson had demanded, as the price of his secrecy,
nothing less than the hand of Harcourt’s betrothed
bride, and the connivance and assistance of
Harcourt in obtaining it by a treacherous plot; and
threatened that, in case these conditions should not
be accepted, to denounce the wretched clerk as the
midnight robber and murderer, to bring him to the
gallows or to the State prison for life, and so to wreck
the lives of the two innocent and honorable women
whom he loved best on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>What could he do but accept the cruel, the crushing,
the infernal terms offered him? he asked himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was not this destiny? Forewritten, unforeseen,
irresistible destiny?</p>

<p class='c009'>So Harcourt swore to himself, before high heaven,
that it was; that he could not have foreseen or prevented
one step in that downward path to perdition.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not responsible, he said to himself, for anything
that had happened; and yet he loathed himself
as a wretch unfit to live. And how Roma would loathe
him when she should know that he had betrayed her
into the power of his rival for some unexplained reason!
And what would his mother think when she
should be told that through his connivance and assistance
Roma Fronde had been entrapped into marrying
Hanson when she thought she was marrying Harcourt?
And what would all his friends think when
they should hear the degrading truth? If his mother
could be spared the knowledge of his dishonor he
thought he could bear the contumely of all the rest
of the world. If, for her own sake, she could be
spared this, which could only be a less sorrow and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>less shame than his trial for robbery and murder and
his death on the gallows could be.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, the poor, humiliated mother! Oh, the fair, forsaken
bride! He had sinned to save them both from
shame and sorrow, and now he awoke, as from a
dream, to find that he had not saved them after all.</p>

<p class='c009'>For what was Roma’s condition now? And what
would Dorothy Harcourt’s be soon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, the maddening conflict of emotion! Oh, the despairing
confusion of thought! Oh, the cruel fate
that had brought him to this and compelled him to
live! Why could he not be annihilated? Where was
the mercy of Heaven?</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked down on the waters of the bay. They
were very dark and still, and almost smooth enough
to reflect the starlit sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is peace,” he murmured to himself; “peace,
rest and oblivion. Why should I not seek it, as a child
seeks sleep? Oh, that I might sink to sleep, and sleep
forever!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment the insane temptation of the suicide
overshadowed him. It would be so easy, so very easy,
for him to drop quietly over the steamer’s side and
find death and forgetfulness in the deep waters of
the Chesapeake. No one would see him sink. No
one would miss him until the next day. Even then no
one would know but that he had got off the boat at
some of the landings where she stopped to put off
or take on passengers or freight. No one there would
be sufficiently interested to inquire what had become
of him. In fact, no one there even knew his name,
or anything about him beyond the fact that he had
been one of a wedding party on that trip. They
were now on the broadest part of the bay. No one
would ever find his body or know his fate. The opportunity
was there, the temptation strong.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma would not care anything about the mysterious
fate of the missing wretch who had entrapped
her into marriage with his rival and her own once
rejected suitor. Only, perhaps, she would be better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>pleased to know that he had met his well deserved
punishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>But his poor, widowed old mother! She would care.
Worse than sorrow for a dead son would be the torture
of anxiety on account of a missing son whose
fate or condition was unknowable. He was her only
child, her only support, her only hope. Could he desert
her in her age and destitution, and leave her with
a load of intense anxiety and horrible doubt added to
her burden of sorrow and poverty? Could he, dare he,
bring this last and bitterest anguish upon her?</p>

<p class='c009'>No! no! no! Hard and ignoble as life must henceforth
be to him, he must bear it—bear it for fifty or
sixty years to come, perhaps.</p>

<p class='c009'>What right had he, indeed, to seek the repose of
death, even if it should be repose instead of eternal
retribution? He, a sinner above all sinners! Even
though he felt that all he had done and all he had
suffered was the work of a forewritten fate, yet none
the less did he feel that he was this sinner above all
sinners, with no right to repose in death, no right to
comfort in life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet he must live and work without hope or heart
in life or labor. He must live and work, not to attain
the honors he had dreamed of, longed for, aspired
to, and must finally have attained but for this
fatal first false step, which had precipitated him to
perdition; not for these brilliant hopes that formed
his “Paradise Lost,” and never to be “Regained”; not
as an ardent student or teacher in the schools and
colleges, among the books and companions that he
loved, and in the atmosphere that was his higher life!
Oh, no! He had forfeited all that. He was unworthy
of such companionship.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should he dare to attempt to earn his living, and
pay for his education, as a teacher of boys?</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah, no! He must live and work as a hard laborer
in some dockyard or depot, carrying heavy burdens,
unfit to associate with the honest workmen who had
lived worthy lives; and he would deny himself everything
but the barest necessities of existence to keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>his poor old mother in the comforts of life so long
as she should live.</p>

<p class='c009'>This hard labor and hard living should be the self-inflicted
“penal servitude” which he felt that he deserved,
and which he knew would have been the lightest
sentence for his deed which the law could have
imposed, and even lighter, as it did not include imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c009'>To devote all his hard earnings to his aged mother’s
benefit, and to go to see her sometimes, to cheer and
console her, should be his own only comfort in his
self-imposed expiation.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he must begin this penal servitude in some
city where he was not known, so that he might keep
the secret of his fall from her. She must never know
of his poverty, privations and hard labor. He would
always contrive to appear before her, on his visits, as
a gentleman—however unworthy the name—so long
as she should live.</p>

<p class='c009'>Afterward, when she should have finished her long
pilgrimage on earth, and passed away to join her
beloved ones gone before, then——</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, when there should remain no one to be distressed
and degraded by his crime, then he would
discharge his hardened conscience of the intolerable
load it bore, and give himself up to justice, to be dealt
with according to law.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not until then could he hope for peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last he succeeded in marking out his future external
life with sufficient clearness of outline, but his
internal life was strangely distracted and confused.
He felt himself to be “a sinner above all sinners,” and
at the same time the irresponsible victim of a chain
of circumstances, the work of irresistible destiny.</p>

<p class='c009'>So deep was his mental abstraction from all surrounding
things and movements, that he knew not
when the man at the wheel or the watch on deck was
relieved until a hand was laid on his shoulder, and
a kindly voice said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Young gentleman, you are looking very ill. Hadn’t
you better go below and turn in?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>It was the early morning watch who spoke to him,
and he answered wearily:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you. Yes, I think I will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he rose slowly and went to his stateroom, and
threw himself into the lower berth. For some time
he lay awake there, intently thinking, intensely suffering,
but with thought and emotion revolving still
in the same circle around the tragedy—the destiny
of his life. At length the body could bear no more,
but succumbed to the exhaustion of many nights’ vigilance,
and he sank into sleep, which was at first a
fitful doze and afterward a profound slumber, which
lasted until noon the next day, when he awoke to find
the boat at Richmond.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, that awakening! Oh, the agony of returning
to life, to memory and to misery, and to the revolving
of thought and feeling around the destined tragedy!
Living it all over again, as if he were sentenced to do
so until death!</p>

<p class='c009'>Without arranging his disordered hair or dress, he
went up on deck, looking so wild and haggard that
one of the deck hands remarked to another:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That young fellow has been on a big drunk, and
is paying for it now, you bet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt had no intention of stopping in Richmond.
He was too well known in the Queen City of the
South. He would go to the North, and lose his identity
in some large town where he had never been
before.</p>

<p class='c009'>New York City offered the largest human wilderness
in which to lose himself. He had never been
there in his life, and had no acquaintances there except
the Bushes and that Belial, Hanson. Hanson
was away, and the Bushes would not be at all likely
to discover him in changed identity.</p>

<p class='c009'>He would go to New York by the first boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>He declined the breakfast offered him by the steward,
gathered his baggage and had it transferred to
the New York boat, which was getting up steam to
start on her northward voyage. He sat on the deck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>staring off into vacancy, as the boat turned and
steamed down the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Young fellow getting over a long spree, I shouldn’t
wonder,” remarked one passenger to another, as they
noticed the pallid skin, haggard features and inflamed
eyes of poor Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew nothing of these comments, but sat there,
gloomy and abstracted, until he was aroused by a
voice near him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do, sir?” it said.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked up, dazed by the sudden and familiar
address from a stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t seem to recognize me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt gazed for a moment longer without speaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Charles Cutts, don’t you know, who landed from
a passing yacht at the Isle of Storms late one night
in September last—a night memorable for the tragedy
enacted there, you know,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—remember—you—now,” Harcourt faltered,
changing color from pallor to green ghastliness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I see that the very sight of me, calling up
the memory of that night, has quite upset you, and
I don’t wonder,” said Cutts, taking a seat beside the
agitated young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I—have not been well lately—I—I have but
recently recovered from a very severe fit of illness,”
faltered Harcourt, in explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Been ill? Indeed, you look as if you had been,
poor fellow! I am sorry for you. I ought not to have
mentioned that dreadful occurrence that drove even
me away from the house,” said Cutts sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>And yet he went on speaking of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fled away from the scene of the so-called suicide
the next morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The so-called suicide,” muttered Harcourt involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; that was what they called it, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The—the—coroner’s jury—after—after investigation—found
it so,” said Harcourt hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes. Sharp fellows, that coroner’s jury. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>need not have run away from them, as I did by the
very boat that went to fetch the coroner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you—run away—from them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; for fear of being summoned as a witness. I
did not want to, in the case of that scoundrel Yelverton.
I knew the fellow in Baltimore. The world is
well rid of him. I think so now, and thought so then.
That was the reason why I hurried off in the early
boat that went to fetch the coroner from Snowden,
to avoid being summoned to give evidence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—but—your room was—at the opposite side—of
the hotel. You could have known nothing—of—of
the manner of—Yelverton’s death,” said Harcourt,
speaking as with the difficulty and hesitancy of an
expiring man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it was not a suicide,” said Cutts positively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my Lord!” exclaimed Harcourt, starting to
his feet and gazing into the stolid face of the speaker,
who had also risen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t wonder it upsets you. It did me, I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it was proved beyond all doubt that Yelverton
died by his own hand,” said the young man, trying
to rally his forces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bosh! Proved to the satisfaction of the Snowden
Dogberries who sat on the coroner’s jury! But there,
young man, I have already said more than I ever intended
to say to any mortal on that subject; only,
you know, the sudden sight of you here on the boat
recalled the whole thing to my mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, pray tell me what reason you have for supposing——”
began Harcourt, but his tormentor cut him short.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell you, nor any one else, nothing. I will
hold my tongue, so help me Heaven, unless——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless what?” asked Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless ‘in the course of human events,’ as Thomas
Jefferson said, some innocent man should be charged
with that very murder, as may happen, for the verdict
of a coroner’s jury is not necessarily and invariably
final. In such a case, to save the innocent, I
would denounce the guilty.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“You know the guilty one, then?” faltered Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have said my last word on this subject, young
man, and I am sorry for having said any word about
it. It is the first time; it shall be the last, except in
the exigency to which I have alluded. You, too,
should turn your thoughts to other matters. Exciting
subjects are not good for convalescents,” said Cutts,
walking away to avoid further discussion of the
subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt felt stunned. He dropped back in his
chair, scarcely able to ask himself, much less answer
to himself, the question, how much did Cutts really
know of that night’s tragedy; yet feeling sure of one
thing—that the Baltimore broker had no disposition
to denounce him.</p>

<p class='c009'>And between them the subject was never mentioned
during the voyage.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='c007'>EXPIATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The steamer reached New York harbor a few minutes
after sunrise.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as she ran alongside of her pier Harcourt
came up on deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Charles Cutts was there, standing with two or three
other passengers, waiting for the gangplank to be
laid down for them to pass ashore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Going to stay long in New York?” inquired Cutts,
coming to his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know yet,” answered Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come this way,” said Cutts, lowering his voice and
walking some little distance from the group.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt followed anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now that we are to part,” said Cutts in a still
lower tone, “I wish you to promise me one thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” inquired Harcourt, seeing that Cutts
paused and hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Never to mention the secret I told you yesterday
morning,” said Cutts solemnly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you told me no secret,” replied Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, the fact that I hinted as to knowing
something more about the death of that scoundrel,
Yelverton, than the coroner’s Dogberries ever suspected.
I never mentioned the fact to any human being
before. Heaven knows I don’t know what in the devil
possessed me to speak of it to you, unless it was because
you were the first and the last and the only man,
except the porter, that I spoke to on that one fatal
night of my visit to the Isle of Storms. Promise me,
on your word of honor, that you will not speak of it
to any one until I give you leave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I promise on my word of honor,” replied Harcourt,
in amazement; for if this man had really seen the manner
of the death of Yelverton by any unknown means,
why should he think it necessary to bind him, Harcourt,
the culprit, by a promise never to mention his
knowledge?</p>

<p class='c009'>“We may, or may not, ever meet again. In the
meantime, I rely on your honor to keep your promise,”
said Cutts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may do so,” replied the young man, still dazed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, good-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gangplank was down, and the passengers were
going off the boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by,” returned Harcourt, and followed the
stream to the pier to begin his new life.</p>

<p class='c009'>First he went to a barber’s shop and had his handsome
dark mustache shaved off, and his rather long,
silken dark hair cut short.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he went to a tailor’s and procured a rough
suit of clothes, which, after trying on, he kept on, and
had his traveling suit put up in a parcel, which he
took under his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>New York shopkeepers are used to all sorts of queer
customers, but they certainly did look a little curiously
after this strange young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An escaped lunatic, I shouldn’t at all wonder,” remarked
the proprietor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Harcourt went in search of cheap lodgings in the
lowest and most crowded part of the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>He saw many placards on the front of tall, dingy
tenement houses with rooms to let, furnished or unfurnished,
with or without board. But on inquiry he
found they were rooms on crowded floors, full of bad
air, and he wanted an attic or a loft, however poor
and bare, that he might have the fresh air which was
so needful for the preservation of his health and ability
to work.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length, after some hours’ wanderings, he found
what he wanted on a street near the water. It was
one of the oldest houses of old New York, the basement
and ground floors used for small groceries and
dry goods and the upper floors as tenements. The
attic, of two large rooms, each with two dormer windows,
was occupied only by a poor, solitary seamstress,
who lived in the front room. The back room
was vacant, and bare of furniture, but, like the attic
rooms of many old houses, in city as well as country,
it had a small open fireplace, with cupboards on each
side of the chimney, and its two dormer windows gave
a fine view of New York Bay, with its picturesque
headlands and islands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seven dollars a month, in advance, was the price
of this attic room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt paid the money, and went out to buy the
cheapest furniture, in the smallest quantity that he
could get on with, but not from second-hand dealers;
his inherited fastidiousness shrank from the close contact
of discarded household goods of whose antecedents
he knew nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>He bought a narrow cot, a straw mattress and pillow,
two sets of bed linen, two pairs of blankets and
a woolen spread, a pine table, a cane chair, a tea kettle,
a coffee pot, a gridiron, and some little crockery
and cutlery. All his furniture, new though it was, did
not cost him more than twelve dollars.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had this all arranged in his room before night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lastly, he went down to the baggage room of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>steamer, claimed his trunk, and had it brought up
to his attic.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had paid the truckman, and shut the door
upon him, he knelt down beside his trunk, and with a
little chisel began to pry out the small brass-headed
tacks that formed the initials of his name—W. E. H.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the agent of whom he rented the room he had
given the name of William Williams, persuading himself
that the doubling of his first name and the suppression
of the other could scarcely be called giving a
false name.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not wish to take into his new life the old
name. His reluctance did not come from any remnant
of false pride. All that was gone now, and William
Harcourt knew that labor with the pick or shovel, the
hod or trowel, honestly performed, was just as honorable
as labor with the pen, the pencil or the voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he wished to guard against the chances of his
mother’s discovery of his hard life, which would certainly
give her great pain and distress, and lead to
questionings that could not be answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the present he hoped and believed that she was
enjoying a rare season of comfort and happiness in
the society of Ruth Elde, at Goblin Hall, and with
the prospect of several weeks of uninterrupted peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not dare to write to her just yet; nor did
he think she would be uneasy at not hearing from
him. She would just think that he was so much absorbed
in his happiness that, knowing she was well
cared for at Goblin Hall, he had delayed writing. She
was not jealous or exacting, this noble Dorothy Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later she must know the truth—that Roma Fronde
had married William Hanson and not William Harcourt;
but, oh! let it be as much later as possible.
How should he tell her? How should he explain his
own part in that wrong? He could not think, and he
told himself it was not necessary to think just now.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had borne as much of the burden of heavy
thought as he could bear without going mad.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had finished picking the tacks out of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>trunk, and shoved it across the bare floor into a corner,
he began to feel faint from fatigue and fasting.
He was also very cold, for there was no fire in the
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went out again, and bought a bucket of coal, a
parcel of kindling wood, a box of matches, a loaf of
bread, a mutton chop and a little coffee, sugar, pepper
and salt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he returned to his attic, kindled a fire in his
rusty little grate, filled his kettle from the water
spigot at the end of the hall, and cooked his frugal
supper.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been accustomed, in his struggling college
days, to wait upon himself, as we have seen, and that
had in some measure prepared him for his present
life. He was habitually neat, and when he had finished
his meal he washed up all utensils, set his room
in order, and then went to sit at one of the dormer
windows to look out upon the night. A starlit sky
hung over the bay, with its islands and headlands and
its groves of shipping.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hum of the city was far below him, and at this
hour it was much lessened. The house was also very
still. No sound was to be heard but the monotonous
motion of the sewing machine worked by the seamstress
in the next room. In this silence and solitude,
thought overwhelmed him. Imagination conjured up
the picture of Roma in her island prison, in the power
of William Hanson. He could not bear this. He
started up with a suppressed cry, and ran downstairs
and into the crowded streets. He pushed through
the crowd to get at freer space and fresher air, and
went on toward the piers.</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked rapidly up and down one of the most
deserted-looking, to fatigue himself into the need of
rest and the possibility of sleep. He walked for hours,
until he began to feel weary; then he slackened his
pace, but still walked and walked, being resolved to
so exhaust his physical powers that his mental faculties
might find rest in unconsciousness. He walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>up and down until from very prostration he had to
stop and sit down on a pile of planks left lying there.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been sitting there some time, felt somewhat
rested, and able to return to his lodgings, and was
about to rise and retrace his steps, when his attention
was attracted by the figure of a man coming toward
him. The man was of low stature, slight and
slim, and would have looked like a boy but for his
stooping shoulders and long beard. He came on, tottering
like an inebriate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Something in his form and manner compelled Harcourt
to look at him. He came on, tottering from
right to left, passed Harcourt without seeing him, and
went on toward the end of the pier. Harcourt, moved
by some inspiration he could not understand, arose
and followed him silently, closely.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the stranger reached the end of the pier,
where the water was deep, he paused, looked down
profoundly, much as Harcourt himself had looked into
the depth of Chesapeake Bay two nights before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is peace there,” the stranger murmured,
using the very words that Harcourt had used under
a recent similar temptation.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then he threw up his arms for the fatal leap.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Harcourt’s swift arms were cast around him
and held him back.</p>

<p class='c009'>The would-be suicide struggled hard to release himself,
but he was weak, very weak, and Harcourt, inspired
by the sudden joy of saving him, held him
fast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me go! Who are you that would save a tortured
and maddened wretch from rest and peace?”
demanded the stranger, still struggling, though now
very feebly, for his poor strength was failing, and he
seemed more like fainting than resisting. “Who are
you? Who are you, I say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Another tortured and maddened wretch, who, two
nights ago, if conscience had not restrained him,
would have sought rest and peace as you wish to seek
them now, but would not have found them, as you
would not have found them if you had taken that fatal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>plunge. What is your trouble, man? Tell me. Possibly,
possibly, possibly, I may be able to help you
bear it. God grant that I may! Come, what is your
trouble?” demanded Harcourt, setting the stranger
down upon a large box, placing himself at his side,
and passing his arm around the man’s waist, the better
to protect him from himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trouble!” cried the other. “Trouble enough! Illness
all autumn. No work. Wife and children freezing,
starving, in a cellar. No food for two days. Everything
pawned but just enough clothes to cover our
nakedness. Trouble, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good Heaven! good Heaven! It is incredible! ‘In
a whole city full!’” exclaimed Harcourt, quoting
Hood. “Come with me. The stores are not all closed
yet. We will get coal and wood, and have a fire and
a supper. Come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I——What do you mean?” demanded the dazed
little man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘All men are brethren.’ I cannot see my brother
hunger or freeze while I have the means of getting
him food and a fire. Come with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Harcourt arose and took the man by the arm
and raised him up.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two walked from the pier.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a restaurant near at hand, Harcourt
first took his protégé in there, ordered beefsteak and
coffee, and made him eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far is your home from this place?” inquired
Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About half a block.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” said the young man. “We will have
something cooked just here and take it with us as
soon as it is ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he ordered half a gallon of stewed oysters, a
quart of strong coffee, and bread and butter for six,
to be put in a hamper to be taken away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know how many you have at home,” he
said, “but the order for six I judged a safe guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are three at home—my wife, son and daughter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the two last quite small children, the boy seven,
the girl five,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. You feel better now?” inquired the
young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, much better, thanks to you; but how or when
can I ever repay you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are repaying me now. I was feeling as unhappy
as you yourself were when I was so blessed as
to save you from suicide. I, too, feel better, much
better now. I am fully repaid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is good of you to look at it in that light. But
have you had trouble, too?” inquired the stranger
with much feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but we will not talk of trouble now. We
both feel better. Here comes the waiter with the
wife’s and children’s supper in the hamper; let us
go to them—that is, if you have finished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I have finished,” said the stranger, pointing to
the empty platters, which he had cleaned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt paid the bill for the stranger’s supper and
for the contents of the hamper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then both arose and left the restaurant, followed
by the waiter, with the hamper, who went with them
to bring back the crockeryware.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stranger led the way to a dingy tenement house
with an open cellar door. The stranger dived down
into this cellar, followed by his two companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>They found themselves in a deep, murky room, with
a damp flagstone floor, damp brick walls, a musty atmosphere,
without furniture, without fire, and without
light, except from the street gas lamp that stood
directly in front of the house, and shone down into
the cellar.</p>

<p class='c009'>By its light they saw three miserable human beings—a
young woman, a little boy, and a baby girl—huddled
together on the damp floor, as if trying to keep
each other warm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, wife, cheer up! Help has come! Here is
supper for you and the children!” said the husband,
taking the hamper from the waiter, who was staring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>in astonishment at the party he had been called upon
to serve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can go back now. It is but a step to your
place, and come later for the dishes—or I can send
them around,” said Harcourt, slipping a quarter into
the waiter’s hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, sir,” said the latter, now quite understanding,
despite Harcourt’s rough suit, that “a gentleman”
had chosen to relieve a starving family.</p>

<p class='c009'>The husband and father had hastily arranged the
food on the cellar floor, and the famished wife and
children had gathered around. He had put a cup of
coffee in the hands of his wife, and was now giving
hot milk to the two children.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a Rembrandt picture, seen in the glare of
the street gas lamp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you no light?” inquired Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Light! Should we have light when we have not
fire, and hadn’t food until you brought it?” exclaimed
the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I will hurry out and try to get some candles
and some coal before the stores are closed,” said Harcourt.
And away he went.</p>

<p class='c009'>He succeeded in buying a bucket of coal, a bundle
of kindlings, a box of matches, a pound of candles, and
a pair of tin candlesticks.</p>

<p class='c009'>With these he returned to his new friends, kindled
a fire in the stove, lighted two candles, and placed
them in the candlesticks, on the floor, and then looked
around.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no furniture of any description in the
cellar, unless a pile of ragged bedclothes, in the dryest
corner, next the chimney, could be called such.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see what you are looking for, sir! But they are
all at the pawnbroker’s, every stick! And the rags
would have been along with the rest if any broker
would have advanced ten cents on them, to buy the
children bread to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is dreadful, my friend, dreadful! I wish I could
do more for you now, but the stores are all closed.
Make yourself as comfortable as you can, under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>circumstances, to-night, and to-morrow I will see you
again. What is your name, by the way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Adler, sir; Abel Adler.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mine is Williams. Good-night. You will see the
hamper of dishes returned?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, sir! Thank you more than words can say,”
responded Adler.</p>

<p class='c009'>“More than words can say,” repeated his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night! good-night!” said Harcourt hastily,
and he hurried out from the cellar.</p>

<p class='c009'>It had cost him almost as much to relieve the pressing
necessities of this poor family as it had to furnish
his own bare attic room, and both outlays had nearly
exhausted the remains of the funds from the payment
of that “old debt” which the “pious fraud” of Ruth
Elde, assisted by her Joe, had invented.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Harcourt did not grudge the money, but he
felt that he must find work at once, or have nothing
to send to his mother, when, in the course of weeks,
he should write to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went up to his attic, but as soon as he found
himself alone there his temporary feelings of relief
left him. While with Adler and his family he had
really felt better, as he had said; but it was the surrounding
and reflection of their happier feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, in the solitude of his attic, remorse and despair
seized him again, much on account of his share
in that tragedy at the Isle of Storms, but more, far
more, for that which had come of it—his black, black
treachery to Roma Fronde. The first might be expiated
when he should give himself up to justice to suffer
the penalty of his offense; but the last—the last!
How should he ever atone for the irreparable wrong
done to Roma?</p>

<p class='c009'>In the soul’s utter extremity to whom can it go but
to its Father in heaven?</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt cast himself down prone upon the floor,
and called upon the name of the Lord, not for pardon—he
dared not—but for some means, through however
much of suffering for himself, to atone for his sin to
Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“I can do nothing! nothing!” he cried. “I have
fallen hopelessly into the pit! But with Thee ‘all
things are possible.’ Thou holdest in Thine almighty
hands the springs of all life and all activity. Oh,
make it so that I may be sacrificed, humiliated, destroyed,
for her sake, so that she may be happy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In his deep despair time passed unheeded. He lay
face downward on the floor of his attic, sometimes
giving vent to the anguish of his soul in deep groans,
sometimes rolling over, but always falling into the
same position, face to the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the wretched night passed, and the morning
dawned and found him there.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the midst of his misery he became conscious that
some one was knocking at his door, and had been
knocking for some few seconds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is there?” he called at length, as he slowly
rose from the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is I, your next neighbor. Are you ill? Can I
do anything for you?” inquired a sweet voice from
without.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Harcourt instantly opened the door, and saw
in the uncertain light of the dawn a woman standing
there. But whether she was young or old, pretty or
plain, he could not tell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you are all in the dark,” she said. “Let me go
and bring my candle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And she was off like a shot, before Harcourt could
speak to prevent her.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he went to his cupboard and lighted his own
candle, so that when she came back with hers the
darkness had fled.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this light he saw that she was a middle-aged
woman; but as middle age is a sort of “movable
feast,” anywhere between thirty and sixty, let us be
a little more definite, and say that she was about forty,
and not at all of the pale, thin, starved needlewoman
and tenement-house type whom to see or hear of is
so heartrending. She was plump, fair, rosy, blue-eyed
and light-haired, with a cheerful and kindly expression,
and she was neatly dressed in a gown of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>some cheap blue woolen material and a white bib
apron.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have been ill all night, I fear, and I am very
sorry for it,” she said as she set her candlestick down
on the table and looked at him. “I heard you groaning
just as soon as I stopped my sewing machine and
could hear anything, but you ceased soon, and I didn’t
think much of it, but went to bed and to sleep. I
always sleep like a top; but this morning, as soon as
I woke up, I heard you groaning worse than ever, and
I blamed myself for not attending to you last night.
Now what is the matter? Tell me. I am a right good
nurse and doctress, but not professional, so I don’t
cost my patients anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very kind, and I truly thank you, but I
am not ill in the body,” replied Harcourt, with a feeble
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in body! Then in mind. But you have not
slept all night, I know, and so you are not well in
body, any more than in mind. Lie down there on
your bed, and I will go and make you a cup of coffee.
No denial, and no thanks, please! I won’t have the
first, and I don’t want the last,” said the neighbor;
and leaving her candle with the other, to make the
room more cheerful, she went back to her own apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Harcourt certainly felt soothed and comforted
by the homely kindliness of his neighbor, and even
supported by the motherly authority she assumed over
him. He went and lay down as she had bid him do.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon he heard her stirring about around her stove
in the next room, humming in a low tone a popular
school song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sing at your work, ’twill lighten</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The labors of the day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sing at your work, ’twill brighten</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The darkness of the way;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sing at your work, though sorrow</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Its lengthened shadow cast;</div>
      <div class='line'>Joy cometh with the morrow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And soon the night is past.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Presently she came in with a generous cup of coffee
and a plate of buttered toast on a battered little black
Japan waiter, the whole covered with a clean, white,
well darned old napkin.</p>

<p class='c009'>She sank down on the solitary chair beside the bed,
and holding the waiter of breakfast in her lap, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now sit up and take this, while I get a good look
at you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again, with a feeble smile, Harcourt obeyed her,
took the offered cup from her hand, and while he
eagerly quaffed the fragrant coffee, which he found
so grateful to his parched throat and fainting frame,
she regarded him with the eyes of experience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, young man,” she said gravely and tenderly,
“you have seen trouble—plenty of trouble, but that is
the lot of human beings. ‘Man is born to trouble as
the sparks to fly upward.’ Ah! and if we in trouble
go upward in spirit to Him who can turn our trouble
to our greatest good, then it will be well with us.
Everything is good that sends us to Him. But there,
I am not going to preach to you. I am not wise enough
nor good enough to do that. I only wanted to drop
that one little hint.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” said Harcourt, setting down his empty cup
on the waiter she still held, “if one has sinned—grievously,
basely, atrociously sinned—what then? What
then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at his pale, haggard, questioning face
for a few moments and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are putting a case that is not your own, I feel
sure. You are incapable of baseness or atrocity. Yet
I will answer your question. If one has sinned—feels
that he has so sinned—despairs because he has so
sinned—still let him go to his Father in heaven. To
whom else in the universe could he go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Christ.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is the Father. But I told you I would not
preach, and I won’t. I only wished to say this simple
thing: Whatever your trouble may be, take it to your
Saviour God. Now let me bring you another cup of
coffee.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Are you not mixing spiritual and material up very
considerably?” inquired Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We cannot help mixing them up in this world.
Were they not so mixed in the ‘last supper’? Are
they not mixed everywhere in this world?” said the
woman as she took up the waiter and went off to
her room to replenish the empty cup from the hot
coffee pot on her stove.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” said Harcourt as he received the second
cup from her hands. “Thank you. But I feel
like a sneak and a coward to be sitting here taking
all these attentions from you and telling you nothing
about myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will tell me after a while. I do not wish to
force your confidence. You will find relief in telling
me after a while; but not so much as you will find
when you carry your burden where I told you to carry
it, and where your New Testament would have told
you, if you had read it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know I don’t read it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because if you did you would not be so low down.
Read your New Testament. But, there, I won’t
preach.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Harcourt smiled. His neighbor so often declared
she would not preach, yet she preached all the
time.</p>

<p class='c009'>She began again:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will give you three words: Read (the Word of
God), work, pray. Now I will leave you. But call on
me any time, day or night, and I will come to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She took up her little waiter and left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the blessing of such a miserable wretch as myself
could avail, I should bless her; but I can obey
her. I will read, work and pray. But, oh! Roma!
Roma! Roma! Where are you now? How are you
now? Will you become reconciled to the love of that
man who loved you enough to wreck his soul and my
own for your sake? I must not think of it. That way,
indeed, ‘madness lies.’ Who is my kind neighbor, I
wonder? She came and ministered to me, and never
told her name or asked mine. True Arabian kindness!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The janitor downstairs said that she was a poor seamstress,
who worked for the ready-made clothing department
of a large store in Grand Street, and that
she was a most respectable woman. To me she is only
my neighbor, with a little gift of preaching. Well,
I must be up and doing. I must go out and look for
work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He went to the water tank and filled his pitcher,
and then washed his face and hands, brushed his hair,
whisked his rough suit of clothes, and went down the
four flights of stairs that led to the street door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Outside, he suddenly thought of Adler’s family, and
determined to go to see them before going to seek
work.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he had not walked half a block before he met
Adler.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” he said, “how is the wife, and how are the
babies?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All well and happy. Had the best breakfast of a
month past off what was left of last night’s supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear it,” said Harcourt, and he
thought how little it took to make some people happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You certainly brought me luck, young boss,” said
the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear that, also, if it is true; but I do
not see how I could have done so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, my luck turned last night, when you picked
me out of the very jaws of hell—first, in the shape of
a good meal for self and wife and kids, the first of any
sort we had in two days; then a good night’s rest for
all, which came from satisfied hunger; then a good
breakfast from the fragments that remained; then,
early this morning, a message from my old boss to
come to work on Rue Street. My boss is in the employment
of a contractor who is pulling down a row
of tenement houses in Rue Street, to put up a row
of fine buildings for stores. They say these houses
have been condemned by the commissioners, and now
they have got to go. Turn around and walk with me,
boss, and I’ll tell you all about it. You see, I am on
my way to work, and want to get there in good time.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Harcourt turned about, and as they went on he
asked his companion:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think that I could get work on that same
job?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You, boss!” exclaimed Adler, stopping in his astonishment
and gazing on the speaker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I am looking for a job,” quietly replied Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You—looking for a job—of that sort?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of any honest sort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that is hard labor of the roughest and dirtiest—pulling
down moldy and pestiferous old houses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No matter; I shall be glad to get it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am hit hard—hit harder than I ever was
in my life!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, boss—not to be offensive—I—I—I—thought
you were a gentleman and a scholar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Need a man be less a gentleman and a scholar because
he takes any honest work he can get, rather
than live in idleness and go in debt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have got me there, boss, sure as a gun. But I
should think you might do better than that—might
get a salesman’s place in an uptown store. You would
be sure to be popular among customers, with your
figure and address.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why should I seek a salesman’s situation in
preference to a laborer’s?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it is nicer and cleaner, and you would be in
better company.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think so; and I prefer to take work that
offers itself, rather than to seek it in vain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, young boss. Here we are,” said Adler,
as they turned the corner, and were at once deafened
by a tremendous crash, and choked by a great enveloping
grayish-white dust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There!” exclaimed Adler, as soon as by coughing
and sneezing he had in some measure cleared his air
pipes, “there! that was the plastering from some failing
partition wall. It was an accident, of course.
They never intended a wall to come down like that;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>but you see they can’t always prevent it, any more
than miners can always prevent a caving in or an
explosion. So you see, sir, the work is not only dirty,
but dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So much the more suited to me,” muttered Harcourt
under his breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope no one was hurt by the falling of that wall,”
said Adler, hurrying on to the scene of destruction,
closely accompanied by Harcourt. The workmen employed
on the job were waiting for the cloud to clear
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>To Adler’s anxious inquiries they answered that no
one was hurt, no one having been near the wall when
it fell. Adler inquired for his own boss, and was directed
where to find him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went, still accompanied by Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “boss,” a tall, hard-featured, dark-skinned man,
with gray hair and beard, and clothed in a business
suit, received the workman with a kindly smile, but
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are an hour behind time, Adler. I shall have
to dock you a quarter of a day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know that, sir, and I am sorry, but couldn’t help
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Adler presented his friend, “Williams,” and
succeeded in getting him “taken on” at a dollar a
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then their section of work was pointed out to them,
and they went together toward it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see,” said Adler, as they hurried on, “you see,
as we are an hour behind, we are docked a quarter of
a day; that is, instead of getting a dollar, we shall
only get seventy-five cents. Just think of it! We
work ten hours for a dollar, and if we are one hour
behind they dock us the wages of two and a half.
’Tisn’t the boss’s fault; it’s the contractor’s. Ross is
not a bad man himself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Harcourt’s self-inflicted penal servitude commenced;
and, indeed, it was a most severe penance to
the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not mind the muscular exertion, the painful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>fatigue of back and limbs unaccustomed to hard work,
but the dust, the dirt, the stench, formed a purgatory
to his sensitive nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>That first night, when he was on his way home with
Adler, he offered to lend the man money to get his
goods and chattels out of pawn, and the latter thankfully
accepted the help.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went to his attic, and, first of all, took a sponge
bath and changed all his clothing. He felt as if he
could scarcely live and breathe until he had done that.
Then he kindled his fire, cooked his chop, boiled his
coffee, and ate his supper.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had washed up his few dishes and put
them away, he snuffed his candle, lighted another, set
them on the table, and sat down to read.</p>

<p class='c009'>Through all this he had heard, and continued to
hear, the monotonous thumper-thumper-thumper-thumper
of his neighbor’s sewing machine. She did
not come near him, however, although he felt sure
that she would come if he should call her, and he felt
less lonesome on that account.</p>

<p class='c009'>About ten o’clock the first fruits of his hard work
began to appear, in the shape of great fatigue and
drowsiness. He went to bed, and, despite mental trouble,
slept soundly—slept until the movements of his
neighbor about her room waked him up, only in time
to get a hurried breakfast and hasten off to his work,
to escape being docked a quarter of a day for losing
one hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a fair sample of many days and nights spent
by young Harcourt. He allowed himself no indulgences,
not even a newspaper, so he never saw the
advertisements for himself, nor, if he had, could he
have answered them.</p>

<p class='c009'>He determined that at the end of one month he
would write to his mother, or go to see her. He
thought that for one month she would be living in
comfort, and even in luxury, at Goblin Hall, and that
she would excuse his silence in his supposed honeymoon
at the Isle of Storms. His honeymoon! Oh!
Father of Mercies! was ever mortal man wounded as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>he was? His mother would be in blissful ignorance
of his real position. There would be no one to tell
her. Hanson would not, and Roma could not. Roma
would be Hanson’s closely watched prisoner until he
should have won her love or conquered her into submission,
and then he would take her on his yacht to
Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, the infernal thought! And the traitor who had
betrayed her to this captivity! Why did not some
thunderbolt from heaven fall upon his accursed head?
He could not think of Roma’s condition and keep his
senses. He fled the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>He would write to his mother, or visit her at the
end of the month, and he would explain, or not, as
circumstances should seem to indicate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was his resolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>But before the month ended a catastrophe prevented
the execution of his plans.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the work of tearing down and clearing away
the old Rue Street tenement houses was finished Harcourt,
still following in the wake of his friend, Adler,
got employment in the upper part of the city, where a
large number of men were at work blasting rock.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been engaged with that gang about a week,
when, at an explosion, a piece of rock struck him on
the side, breaking three of his ribs and knocking him
down senseless from the nervous shock.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one knew him there but Adler, who instantly
identified him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was carried to the nearest hospital and entered
under the name of William Williams. He was supposed
to be, and reported to be, a native of South
Wales, his complexion and his general appearance
favoring that theory.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will not weary my reader with any details of his
illness. Let it be enough to say that it was long,
tedious, and very dangerous. The utmost skill and
devotion of the hospital doctors and nurses only sufficed
to save his life, after many weeks, as “a brand
plucked from the burning.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>And if his illness was long and tedious, his slow
convalescence was even longer and more tedious.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adler and his “neighbor” had been constant in their
visits to him, whenever they were allowed to see him.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was late in December when he had been stricken
down. It was late in March when he was reported
cured.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was to have been discharged on Monday morning,
but Adler pleaded that he might be let out on
Sunday, as on that day he and another friend would
be at leisure to take charge of him and see him comfortably
installed in his home. Adler’s plea was
granted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adler and his neighbor both came that day to escort
him home.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he reached his attic room he found everything
in good order—a fire lighted in the stove, and materials
for a good dinner on hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is this?” he inquired, turning to his two
friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We did it,” said Adler. “But I ought to tell you.
Your month wanted a few days of being up when you
were stricken down, so when I heard that you were
not likely to be out of bed for two months to come,
even if then, I took it upon myself, as your next friend,
you know, to give up your room to save the rent. And
as you had paid in advance, without any promise of
giving warning when you wanted to leave, I had no
trouble with the agent. And then I and Annie, your
neighbor here, moved all your traps into her room for
safe keeping. And when we heard that you were to
come out this week I went and engaged the room
again, and we moved your traps back and fixed it up
for you, and here you are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven bless you both,” said Harcourt fervently
as he sank into his chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s all right. One good turn deserves another,”
said Adler carelessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, will you tell me the name of my good neighbor
here, whom I have only known as my neighbor?”
Harcourt asked.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Annie Moss. I thought you knew. I thought
everybody knew her. She is a widow, quite alone in
the world, except for the boy brother of her late husband,
who is out in Colorado somewhere, seeking his
fortune, but not finding it, somehow. He never sends
her anything,” Adler exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He can’t help it, poor fellow. His one dream is
to strike ore some day and make a lady of his mammy,
as he always calls me, though I am only his elder
sister-in-law,” Annie added; and then she began to
prepare chicken broth for the convalescent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt made some faint effort to prevent her,
and to wait on himself, but neither Annie nor Adler
would permit him to stir from his chair. When his
meal was ready they drew the little table up before
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you? Have you dined?” anxiously inquired
Harcourt, before tasting his soup.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I am going right away now to get my dinner
with the wife and babies. Only day in the week I
can do it, you know. In better quarters now, right
around the corner, over the baker’s shop. Will look
in again to-night. Good-by. Annie’ll take care of
you,” said Adler, and he left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you?” said Harcourt, turning to his neighbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going to keep you company in a bowl of this
soup. That is all,” said Annie, and she took a bowl
and spoon from the corner cupboard, helped herself
from the pot on the stove, and sat down near him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid I have got very much in debt,” said
Harcourt uneasily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be afraid of anything. Be quiet, and rest
on this blessed Sabbath day. To-morrow, when you
look into your affairs, I think you will find that you
are not in debt at all, except to Adler, who must have
advanced a month’s rent before he secured this room
for you again—not that he has said anything about
it, though.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I have enough to pay him, but the hospital——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You were in the free ward there.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Harcourt’s pale face flushed crimson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the pauper ward?” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You could not help being there. It was not your
fault. Why should a man mind that, if it is not his
fault?” inquired Annie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, indeed?” assented Harcourt humbly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Besides, if you do not like to rest under an obligation,
you can, when you are able, make some donation
to the hospital that may cover the cost of your
treatment there. And now that you have finished
your soup you must lie down and try to sleep, and
I will take these things into my room and wash them
up,” said Annie, and she also rose and went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt stretched himself on his bed, but he did
not go to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mind was full of anxiety. It was now four
months since that fraudulent marriage ceremony—four
months since he had seen or heard from his
mother or written to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where was Roma now? Traveling in Europe with
her husband, probably. Had she become reconciled
to her lot? And what was her judgment of him? He
did not dare to think.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps in the future, when his poor mother should
have passed to her eternal home, and he should give
himself up to justice, “to be dealt with according to
law,” and the whole story of his life’s deep tragedy
should come out, Roma might judge him leniently.
But how was that poor mother, even now? How had
she borne the suspense and anxiety of his mysterious
silence? Did she perhaps think that he had gone
abroad with his rich wife, and totally forgotten his
poor mother? Or had she in some way learned the
truth?</p>

<p class='c009'>He felt that he could not write at this late date; he
must go and see his mother, and find out her condition
for himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had saved a little money from his wages. He
arose and went to his trunk to see how much that
might be. He found the key hanging on the little nail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>in the dark corner of the cupboard, where he had been
accustomed to keep it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Either Annie had never found it when she removed
his goods from the room, or else she had replaced it,
for there it hung.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took it down, unlocked his trunk, and found and
counted his money. Nineteen dollars. Enough to repay
Adler the sum advanced for his rent and to bear
his expenses to Logwood. Besides, there was his
trunk full of costly wearing apparel that he would
never want again, and might sell for a considerable
sum. He would sell everything except one suit of
gentleman’s clothing and three changes of fine underclothing,
which he would keep to wear when he should
go to see his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mind was now made up.</p>

<p class='c009'>He locked his trunk and threw himself on his bed
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a while his neighbor brought him a large cup
of tea, which he drank gratefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” she said, taking away the empty cup, “I will
bid you good-night; but if you should want anything,
call me, and I will come to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And with these words she went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later Adler came up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Harcourt told him of his wish to go and see
his aged mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot wait to write and hear from her. I must
fly to see her. I did intend to go to see her within a
few days, when I was prevented by that accident that
laid me up for nearly three months. I am her only
son—her only child, indeed—and she is a widow. I
must go and end her suspense,” Harcourt explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed, you must go,” Adler assented.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Harcourt told his friend of his wish to dispose
of his trunkful of clothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Adler mentioned the name of a second-hand
dealer who would give him a fair price.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is, as fair as ever they give. You know,
whether it is a book or a coat that you want to sell
second-hand, they will tell you that they will have to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>sell it at half price; and to make any profit they can
only give you quarter price. I will go with you there
to-morrow, at the noon recess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt thanked him, and the appointment was
made.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adler stayed with his friend until nine o’clock, and
then left him, with the advice that he should go to
bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt followed his good counsel, and retired, but
could not sleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='c007'>NEWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He rose early from a restless bed, dressed, and
made a cup of coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>Afterward he selected the clothing he meant to
retain, and locked the other in his trunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little after twelve o’clock Adler came in, accompanied
by a dealer from Chatham Street, to whom
Harcourt exhibited his trunk of wearing apparel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dealer looked carefully over the whole assortment,
and then for a gentleman’s wardrobe worth at
least two hundred dollars, trunk included, offered—fifty.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was indeed a sacrifice, and Adler loudly protested;
but Harcourt was anxious to conclude the
bargain and be off on his journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he took the fifty dollars cash and delivered over
the trunk, which the dealer agreed to send for, and
did send for in the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adler went back to his work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall start for Washington by the night train,”
Harcourt said, on seeing him out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right; that leaves at nine-thirty. I shall drop
in here to see you off. But what about your room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall leave it just as it is, for I expect to return
to it in a week or ten days’ time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad to hear that,” said Adler, as he hurried away.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Harcourt went back to his room and packed his
traveling bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>When all his preparations for the journey were
completed Harcourt went and rapped on the door of
his neighbor’s room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The monotonous thumper-thumper-thumper-thumper
of the sewing machine stopped while she arose
and came and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked surprised and pleased at the appearance
of her visitor in his genteel morning suit. It was the
first time he had ever come to her door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going away for a few days, Mrs. Moss, to see
my mother. Before I say good-by let me thank you
again for all your great kindness to me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you would not make so much of a simple
matter of duty, done with much satisfaction. But
come in and sit down, and tell me all about it, if you
have time,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you. I have not much time, but I would
like to come in,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>He followed her, and took the chair she offered.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a large, clean room, barely furnished with
a table and four chairs, a corner cupboard, a cooking
stove, a sewing machine, a chest of drawers, and a
little white bed; but the neatness and cleanliness of
the place could not have been surpassed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is not much to tell,” he said. “My mother
is old—quite old, for I was her youngest born, the
child of her age. I am all that she has left. I fear
that my long silence in the illness has made her painfully
anxious, and I think the best and soonest way
to alleviate that anxiety will be to go to her at once,
instead of writing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you are quite right. Indeed, you should
never have left her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not willingly, but ‘necessity knows no law.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! true, now long will you be gone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not over ten days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And your room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please use it yourself, whenever you like to change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the scene, and look out on the bay instead of the
street,” said Harcourt with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you; I will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now I must say good-by. I hear Adler’s step
on the stairs, and he has promised to see me off,”
said Harcourt, rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by,” she said, giving him her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so they parted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adler was waiting for him in the passage, and greeted
him with a hearty “Good-evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt put on his ulster, his seal hat and his
gloves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adler took up his carpetbag, and insisted on carrying
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>They walked to the Cortlandt Street ferry, which
was not far off, took the boat, and in due time reached
Jersey City and the depot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take my advice,” said Adler, as they went toward
the ticket office, “‘cuss the cost,’ and take a sleeping
car. You are not yet strong enough to sit up all
night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But must do so, nevertheless,” replied Harcourt,
true to his resolution of stern self-denial.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took his ticket, bade his friend a hasty good-night,
and hurried to the train, and just boarded it as
it began to move slowly out of the station.</p>

<p class='c009'>To some constitutions the motion of the cars is a
sedative, particularly at night, when darkness and
drowsiness help the effect. This was the case with
Harcourt in his weakened condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the hours of the night passed on he dozed,
dreamed, woke up, and dozed again, until at length
his slumber grew deeper, and he slept until the train
reached Washington, at six o’clock on that dark March
morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had intended to take the train immediately for
West Virginia and go directly to Logwood and Lone
Lodge cabin to see his mother, but on finding himself
in Washington an irresistible longing seized him to go
down to Snowden and get news of Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without stopping to get breakfast he hastened to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>change cars, and was soon en route for Southern Maryland.</p>

<p class='c009'>The close of the day brought him to the little seaside
town.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was known there only as the late hotel clerk,
and not at all as the sometime suitor for the hand of
the heiress of the Isle of Storms.</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked from the depot to the village hotel, and
entered the barroom.</p>

<p class='c009'>The landlord, who was on duty there, instantly recognized
him, and rose to greet him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! How do you do, sir? How do you do? You
are a great stranger here. And yet I have been looking
for you a long time, too,” he said, offering his
hand, and heartily shaking that of the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looking for me?” inquired Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, for weeks past, I may say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you know, if you remember, I am postmaster.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, piles and piles of letters have come
here for you, and here they are. I advertised them,
all to no purpose, and on the first of next month I
meant to send them to the dead-letter office.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are they? Give them to me,” eagerly demanded
Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The landlord took them from a pigeonhole marked
H and handed them over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are these all?” inquired the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Them’s all,” replied the landlord.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “piles and piles” had resolved themselves into
five letters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt sat down on the first seat that offered,
glanced at the dates on the postmarks, and selected
the latest, as having the last news, and that was three
weeks old. It had been written, at the instance of
old Martha, by the hand of May Wynthrop, imploring
Mr. Harcourt to come and see his mother, who was
in good bodily health, but who was pining to see
him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“She was in good health three weeks ago, thank
heaven! And yet she must have suffered several
weeks of suspense and anxiety previous to that. I
must lose no more time, but take this night’s train
for Logwood,” Harcourt thought to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened and read the other letters, but they were
all to the same purport.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had finished them all he put a strong constraint
upon himself, and inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you tell me anything about the young married
couple who came down here last November to
spend their honeymoon on the Isle of Storms?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For all answer, “mine host” lifted up his head,
pursed up his lips, and gave a long whistle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does that mean?” inquired Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The landlord grew very grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, young gentleman,” he said solemnly, “I
don’t know the rights of it, but this is certain—bride
and groom quarreled and parted before they became
husband and wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” demanded Harcourt, starting to his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a positive fact, I do assure you. The marriage
never went any further than the ceremony. The
contract never went into effect. The bride swore that
she was married to the man without her own knowledge
or consent, and that she would never acknowledge
him as her husband. Passing strange, but true
as truth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt dropped into his chair again, overwhelmed
with emotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” he exclaimed. “Well, what next? What
became of her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She managed to communicate with her friends,
and they came—a middle-aged gentleman and lady—and
they took her off the island. The party stopped
here, though I didn’t know the least in the world who
they were, or that the beautiful young woman was the
bride, or that there was any trouble. It was long
after they left here that I found out all about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you find out at last?” inquired Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Through things that happened. On the very afternoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the bride left the island with her friends one
of the most terrible storms that ever visited these
parts came up. That was why the party stopped here
instead of going right on, as they meant to have done.
Well, among other damage that the storm did, it carried
away the boats and boathouses from the island,
and left the people cut off from communication with
the mainland and the rest of the world. But in a
week or ten days after there comes a fine, fast-sailing
yacht to the isle, and stays a few hours, and then
sails away again. And we all here, knowing nothing
about the real facts, thought the bride and groom
had gone off on a cruise, probably to southern waters—coast
of Florida, Gulf of Mexico, or the West
Indies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on,” said Harcourt eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, after a while, I thought of those two poor
negroes left there alone, without any means of communicating
with the mainland and the rest of the
world. So, on one mild day in Indian summer, I jest
got Len Poole to take me in his big boat over to the
island, to see after them poor niggers, who might be
starving for aught I knew. People may think it was
curiosity that took me, if they like, but it was not,
sir, it was not. It was humanity, sir, humanity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no doubt of it,” said Harcourt, who was
anxious for the remainder of the story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir, I went, and it was from them two honest
niggers that I heard the facts about that quarrel and
parting. Why, they told me from the time she entered
the house, a newly married bride, in her wedding
dress, to the time her aunt came and took her away,
she never permitted him to cross the threshold of
her door. No, sir! There was a vixen for you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did the man make any opposition to her departure?”
Harcourt inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; he was not in a state so to do. Her cruelty
had driven him to drink. He was dead drunk when
she left with her aunt and uncle, and he didn’t come
to himself until the next morning, when he woke up
to find that the old folks had carried off his bride and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the storm had carried off his boats so that he couldn’t
go after her. Then there was the loveliest little circus
you ever heard of in your life. He was harlequin,
clown, pantaloon, and a whole menagerie of wild
beasts, all in one, and them niggers was the only audience.
But the lady was gone, and the lady was safe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, glorious Roma! Queen! goddess! I might
have known that you would deliver yourself from the
power of the beast!” muttered Harcourt to himself,
and he felt as if the last few months had been only
a dark nightmare, from which he was now awakening.
Not that even now he hoped ever to possess Roma,
but—she had escaped the deep dishonor of a union
with Hanson; and now such a load was lifted off
Harcourt’s breast, he breathed so freely; he was almost
happy. Yes, though he might never see Roma
again, though she could never be able to forgive him
for the foulest wrong ever done to any human being;
though he must remain in her memory as one guilty,
degraded, accursed, still he was now almost happy,
for she was free and safe. She, his queen—ah! no,
not his queen! But she, the queen, the goddess, the
glorious woman, who had liberated herself, was free!
“Thank God! Oh, thank God!” he breathed from the
depths of his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seems like you take a great interest into this, sir.
Now, if you’d like to get the facts at first hand, you
can just hire a boat and go over to the island, and
them niggers will tell you all about it, and take pleasure
in so doing,” said the landlord.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt reflected—as well as a man might reflect
who was in a tumult of emotions—and then inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What time does the train pass here which connects
with the Western Virginia line?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At eleven-fifty-five sharp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will give me time to go to the isle. I will
walk down to the beach and see if I can get a boat;
and I should like some supper at about eleven o’clock,
before I leave for West Virginia,” said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you go by that train, do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“All right. You shall have supper before you go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” said Harcourt, with a short bow, as he
left the office.</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked down the village street until it merged
into the country road that led to the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c009'>There, after some little inquiry, he found a boatman
and then a boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun had set, but the sky was very clear, and
brilliant with starlight. The wind was low, and the
waters were still, and all circumstances favored a safe
and pleasant row to the isle, that lay, as usual, like
a preadamite sea serpent, coiled on the dark, glimmering
surface of the sea, some miles distant from
the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt took one oar and the boatman took the
other. A rapid row of half an hour brought them to
the isle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be cold for you to remain here. Will you
come up to the house?” inquired Harcourt as he
stepped ashore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lord, no! I’ll just fasten the boat, and walk
up and down here to keep myself warm until you
come back, if you won’t be long,” replied the boatman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall be an hour, at least. But if you feel cold,
come up to the house at any time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right; I will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt stepped rapidly up the rugged face of the
crest and toward the dark mass of buildings on the
top. The house seemed all shut up and dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked around to the rear of the mansion, and
saw one dim light shining through a low window—kitchen
window, probably; but before he could approach
nearer a chorus of barks from three dogs defied
him, and these were instantly followed by the appearance
of an old negro man at the door beside the window,
and a startled voice inquiring:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who dar? Name o’ de Lord, who is yer, an’ wot
do yo’ want?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Rusalem, is that you?” inquired Harcourt, by way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of opening conversation, though he was sure of the
old man’s identity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cose it’s me! But who de name o’ de Lord is yo’?
Shet up, dogs! Hol’ yo’ jaws dar, I tell yo’! A body
can’t hear deirselves speak fo’ yo’! Who is yo’, an’
wot do yo’ want yere?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you remember Will Harcourt, who was clerk
here last summer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’y, sho! ’Tain’t yo’! W’y, Lor’s! ’Member yo’?
Well, I reckon I doane ’member nobody else! Down,
dogs! Stop it, can’t yo’? Come in, sah. Well, Lor’s!
Who’d a think to see yo’ here? Come on. My ole
’oman’ll be moughty proud to see yo’. ’Deed will
Wilet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt followed the old negro into the spacious
kitchen, where a huge fire was burning in the open
fireplace, at the lefthand corner of which sat Wilet,
smoking her pipe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yere, ole ’oman! Yere’s a stranger come to see
us! Young Marse William Harkurt, wot used to be
clerkin’ yere long o’ dat po’ w’ite trash, Tom Todd—Tom
Todd! He were a proper fellah fo’ a young
g’eman to be clerkin’ long o’, or fo’ ’spectable colored
people to be sarvin’, he were! But, Lor’s! de worl’s
turn upside down, it is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, Wilet had risen from her seat, put down
her pipe, and was courtesying to the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, yo’ take dis cha’, yite ’fo’ de fire, young
ge’man. Sorry we ain’t got no fire in de pa’lor fo’
yo’,” she said, drawing up the one comfortable seat
of the room, a flag-bottomed rocker with a patchwork
cushion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you. This will do very well,” said Harcourt,
taking his seat, and then adding: “Now, sit
down, both of you, for I wish to have a talk with you;
and take your pipes. I don’t object to smoke.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wouldn’t yo’ condorcent to take a pipe yo’se’f, sah?
Ise got a new clay one, an’ some prime bakker,” said
’Rusalem politely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, no. I never smoke, though I do not
dislike it.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Well, den, young marse, it’s a cole night, an’ so I’ll
jes’ hang my kettle ober de fire, and pit some apples
down to yoast on de haff, an’ ’Rusalem will get out his
jug o’ w’isky—it’s prime, an’ none o’ p’ison, like Tom
Todd used to sarve out to his cursemores—Tom Todd!
We knows dis is prime, caze we gits it yight f’om de
’stillery, an’ it ’quainted wid de ’stillerers. An’ I’ll
make yo’ de lubblies’ bowl o’ apple toddy, wid sugar
an’ spices, an’ ebberyfin’ ’cordin’, like I use’ to brew
fo’ ole Marse Henry Guyon an’ de gemmen, o’ winter
nights; an’ ebbery single gemman drink my apple
toddy, an’ praise it to de skies. Yes, sah. An’ now
I gwine to make some fo’ yo’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! no! I thank you very much, but I never drink
anything of the sort. I wish to speak to you about the
young couple who came here to spend their honeymoon,”
said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Honeymoon!” echoed Wilet. “Honeymoon! Whew!
Whip yo’ hosses!—pepper-winegarmoon! witriolmoon!—fire-an’-brimstonemoon!”
exclaimed Wilet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard in Snowden that they had parted,” said
Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, young ge’man,” said Wilet, “I ’members
yo’ come down in de boat ’long ob dem, but didn’t
come in, nor likewise eben speak to nobody. Yo’ went
yight back to de boat. But ef yo’ had come in an’
stayed yere—oh! I tells yo’ yo’d ’a’ seem a circus!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me all about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, seein’ as yo’ seems to be an intermit frien’
ob de parties, I doane care ef I do,” said Wilet, and
she began, and told Harcourt the whole story of
Roma’s two days’ ordeal while a captive on the Isle
of Storms. She told him more than she had told the
landlord of the Snowden Hotel, whom she did not recognize
as a friend of the family. She told him how
it was that Roma, captive, guarded, had yet managed
to communicate with her friends. For Wilet, either
by accident or eavesdropping, had overheard the story
of the carrier pigeon, as discussed by Roma and Mr.
and Mrs. Gray on the morning of her departure from
the island.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Oh, Roma! your own glorious deliverer!” said Harcourt
to himself, when the story was finished. “Now
I can brave and bear the very worst that fate may
have in store for me. Now you are free, queen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He arose, and thanked Wilet for her information,
gave each negro a dollar to buy “bakker,” and declining
their urgent offers of supper and bed, he bade
them good-night, and returned to the boat, near which
the boatman was walking up and down, beating his
breast and sides to keep warm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Half an hour’s rapid rowing took them to the mainland.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt found his supper waiting at the hotel. He
had just time to eat it, pay his bill, and catch the
night train for West Virginia.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='c007'>DOROTHY HARCOURT’S SECRET</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was a wild, windy, blustering night in March
when the train ran into Logwood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Harcourt was the only passenger who got off
at that little way station, and he had no luggage but
his carpetbag, which he carried in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was but eight o’clock, yet it was quite dark, and
the station was deserted by all except the ticket clerk
and the night porter. There was not a vehicle of any
kind on the spot, nor, indeed, if there had been would
Harcourt have availed himself of the convenience.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without even entering the station he stepped from
the platform down to the country road, and set off
on a brisk walk to Lone Lodge plantation.</p>

<p class='c009'>After his harassing journey in the cars, on a zigzag,
cross-country route, during which he had had to
change trains several times, and twice to wait hours
for the connection, he felt it as a sort of relief to walk,
to stretch his limbs along a direct road, on this dark,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>wintry, but bracing night. The wind was in his back,
too, and rather helped than impeded his progress.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour’s rapid walk, up and down hill, through
woods, and across streams rudely bridged by logs,
brought him in sight of Lone Lodge. Lights glanced
between red curtains of the lower windows, showing
that the family had not yet retired.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was not to the house of his forefathers that
he was going. Before he reached the acacia avenue,
leading up to the front of it, he turned to the left and
followed a little path down the wooded hill that
brought him to the edge of the narrow, singing stream
that ran half around the hut.</p>

<p class='c009'>He crossed it, and looked at the humble cot which
had been his mother’s shelter ever since the loss of
their home and fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a dim light shining through the little
window of the kitchen, but none through that of his
mother’s room. It struck him as strange and ill-omened,
and now, as he came nearer, he saw that
there was something the matter with the roof of the
house, he could not see what.</p>

<p class='c009'>Full of misgiving, he went and rapped at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>A frightened voice answered him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, who dar? Wot yo’ want dis time ob night?
I got gun! ’Deed is I! I shoot! ’deed will I!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is I, Martha! Open the door and let me in! How
is mother?” called Harcourt impatiently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Open flew the door, disclosing Martha’s tall figure
and astonished face. Before she could speak, Harcourt
repeated his question:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How—how is my mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She—she’s well—dat is, toler’ble well. The Lord
a-messy upon me, young marse! Who’d ’a’ ’spected
to see you yere to-night? Come in, honey. Come in
an’ warm yo’se’f,” said the woman, standing aside to
let him pass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank heaven, she is well! Has she retired?” inquired
the young man as he entered the kitchen and
threw himself into the only chair, which Martha had
hastily set by the little fire of pine knots.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Yes, sah, de ole madam is ’tire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is she asleep, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, young marse—soun’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I can go in and look at her without disturbing
her,” said the young man, rising to pass into the
other room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, yo’ can’t, young marse! No, yo’ can’t, indeed,
sah! Set down an’ rest yo’se’f!” exclaimed the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt dropped into his seat. A new fear seized
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” he demanded. “You say that
she is well, you say that she is sound asleep! Do you
mean—do you mean——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean yight wot I say, nuffin besides. De ole
madam is asleep in her comfortable bed, but it ain’t in
dis mis’ble log house; it’s in de big house wot used
to was her berry own,” Martha explained, in breathless
haste.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt threw himself back on his chair with a
sigh of relief, and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand you. You mean to say that
your mistress is staying at Lone Lodge?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat’s wot I mean to say, young marse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But still I don’t understand, how she should be
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know yo’ don’t, young marse; but now ef yer let
me get yer some water to wash dat dere brack ingyne
smut often yo’ face, an’ make yo’se’f comfor’able w’ile
I hangs on a kittle an’ get yo’ some supper, den I’ll
tell yo’ all about it,” said Martha. And she got up
and filled two large pitchers, one with hot water from
a pot that stood on the hearth, and one with cold
water from a pail on the shelf, and took both into the
adjoining room, which had once been her mistress’.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt not unwillingly followed her, deferring
his interest until after he had finished his simple
toilet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’s got a heap to tell yo’, young marse, an’ dat’s
de trufe; but I kin tell it to yo’ w’ile yo’ eatin’ yo’
supper,” said Martha, as she laid some clean, coarse
towels on the rough washtable.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Now I’s gwine to hurry up dat supper,” she added,
as she left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t know how it is, but the negroes of Maryland
and Virginia, no matter how poor they may be
in all other respects, always, or nearly always, contrive
to have “something good to eat in the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Harcourt had thoroughly washed and combed
himself, and changed all his clothes from the resources
of his carpetbag, he went into the kitchen, to find a
substantial supper laid on the neat table, and a pot
of fragrant tea steaming on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ’pared it all yere, young marse, ’caze I didn’t
want to ’sturb yo’ w’ile yo’ was washin’ an’ dressin’,
nor likewise to keep yo’ waitin’ arter yo’ got t’rough.
Now it’s all yeddy fo’ yo’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt sat down to tea, home-made bread, sweet
butter, new-laid eggs and fried rashers of bacon. And
if he did not do honor to Martha’s cooking it was
because his appetite was not yet good, and not because
the supper was plain, as the poor woman insisted
that it was, with many apologies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See, ef I’d knowed yo’ was comin’, young marster,
I’d had some hot yoles an’ fried chicken, an’ cakes
an’ ’serves; but yo’ tak’ me so unawares,” she said, as
she removed the dishes and cleared the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed. I have had all I want, Martha, except the
news you promised to tell me, and I am ready for
that now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All yight, young marster. Yo’ draw yo’ cha’ up to
de fire, an’ soon’s ebber I fole up dis tablecloff I come
an’ sit down on dat little cricket an’ tell yo’ all about
it. I’s got heaps to tell yo’, an’ dat’s de trufe,” said
Martha, completing her last act in setting the place
in order.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she drew a small bench—called in her parlance
a cricket, probably because of its being an humble
little chimney-corner seat, and began her story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yo’ know dat time w’en ole mist’ess went sudden
to de city?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” sighed Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, she nebber tell me wot took her off so sudden.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Said she’d tell me w’en she got back. But,
Lor’!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’y, ’fo’ she were ready to come back, my po’ ole
man—po’ Moses—tak’ sick; he did, my po’ ole man
did; an’ w’en he t’ought he was goin’ to die he got a
letter writ to ole mist’ess to come home, ’caze he had
somefin mighty pa’tickler to ’fess to her ’fo’ he went.
Yo’ heerd all ’bout my po’ ole man goin’ to glory, o’
coorse, young marster?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” Harcourt replied, with a twinge of compunction,
for he had forgotten even to inquire after faithful
old Moses, although he might have missed him from
the cabin. “I am very sorry to hear of your loss,
Martha; very sorry indeed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ yo’ nebber year ’bout it ’fo’, young marse?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, see dat, now. W’ere yo’ been all dis time,
not to year ’bout it, young marse? But dere, I know
yo’ been off to collidge, ’way f’om eberybody, ’cept
’twas books an’ sich. An’ nobody to yite to yo’, ’cept
’twas ole mist’ess, an’ she not capable of yitin’ eber
since my po’ ole man die. So ’ow could she tell yo’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop!” exclaimed Harcourt, again alarmed and
mystified. “Just now you said that your mistress was
well. Now you say that she was incapable of writing
to me. How is this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Young marse, she is as well—de ole madam is—as
any ageable ole lady ob her time ob life can be in
body healf; but she can’t settle down her min’ on to
yitin’; no, she can’t—de ole madam can’t. But she’s
well—well an’ likewise happy; happier now ’an’ she
hab been since de ole marse fell in battle—de ole
madam is. Yes, sah!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Happier! Thank heaven! But how and why should
she be happier, or happy at all—the poor mother?”
inquired Harcourt, more and more bewildered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, young marse, if yo’ will hab patience, an’
let me tell yo’ a straight story, I’ll tell it, an’ no lie;
but doane yo’ jump or ’xclaim, or yo’ll be sure to put
me out.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Very well; very well, Martha. Pray go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, den, de ole madam, w’en she were wrote for
by Miss Marg’et up to de big house, she come yight
down, she did—de ole mist’ess did—by de night train,
so she ’ribed at Logwood in de dark, lonesome hours
arter midnight, an’ got yere jus’ ’fo’ day, de ole madam
did, mos’ we’ out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor, dear mother! At her age, too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, at her age, too. It’s de trufe. Well, as my
po’ ole man was asleep jus’ den, an’ we didn’t wan’
to wake him, fo’ fear it would shorten ob his days—hours,
I mean—I ’suaded ob de ole madam to go to
bed, an’ I gib her a cup o’ tea, wid furty drops ob
lodomy in it—yes, sah, did—an’ I knowed wot I was
a-doin’ ob, fo’ she was dat we’ out, an’ same time dat
’cited, I knowed ef she didn’t go to sleep yight off,
somefin would happen to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Martha!” Harcourt exclaimed, “it was a hazardous
thing to do, without the doctor’s orders.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dere want no doctor in yeach, an’ de case was immigrent.
’Sides w’ich, I knowed wot to do my ownse’f,
an’ I did it. De ole madam didn’t train me in nussin’
not fo’ nuffin—de ole madam didn’t, ’deed didn’t she.
An’ I gib her de sleepin’ stuff on de sly, unbeknowed
to herse’f, I did. An’ de ole mist’ess she took it, an’
went to sleep, an’ slep’ like a angel, she did, de ole
mist’ess did, tell two o’clock in de arternoon. My po’
ole man he woke up fus’, my po’ ole man did, and he
’quired ’bout de ole mist’ess, an’ w’en he yeared as she
were in de house he were satisfied, my po’ ole man
were; an’ he waited patient till she wake up, an’ had
her breakfas’, my po’ ole man did. Young marse, if
ebber Marfar Mungumbry go to de dark worl’, it’ll be
all along ob pious lyin’,” suddenly exclaimed the
woman, interrupting her story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How so?” inquired Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Caze I had to lie yight an’ lef’ dat day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To keep dem two po’ souls quiet. W’en de ole
mist’ess wake up, she say, she do, she say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Is Moses ’wake yet?’</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“An’ I answer an’ say, I do:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘No, ole mist’ess, my po’ ole man is soun’ ’sleep.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ dat were lie de fus’. An’ den I say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I yeckon by de time yo’ get dress an’ get yo’ breakfas’,
my po’ ole man will youse up.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den I jus’ slip ’way one minute to see how my po’
ole man was gettin’ on. An’ dere he was moanin’ to
hisse’f, an’ gettin’ berry impatient at long las’, an’
sayin’, as soon as ebber he see me:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Is she ’wake yet? Oh, is she ’wake yet?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ I say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘No; she soun’ ’sleep.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Caze yo’ see, young marster, I wanted de ole mist’ess
to get a comfor’able breakfas’ fo’ gwine frough
any tryin’ time, long ob my po’ ole man. An’ dat
was lie de frurd. An’ so I kep’ on gwine f’om one
to tudder, lyin’ fas’ as a horse could trot, ’til ole mist’ess
was dress’ an’ had her breakfas’ good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well? And then?” demanded Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den I tole her as my po’ ole man was woke up,
an’ she went in to see him. An’ w’en she see how
low he were she look mighty ’stress, an’ she say—de
ole madam say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Moses,’ she say, ‘I’m berry sorry to see yo’ sick.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ she set down by his bed an’ put her han’ on
his fo’head. An’ he say—my po’ ole man say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Mist’ess, I ain’t wurvy fo’ yo’ to care ’bout me.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den he say to me, he say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Marffy, chile, yo’ go ’way. I got somefin to say
to de madam w’ich I mus’ say to herse’f alone.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“So, young marse, I went out ob de room, an’ lef’
de ole mist’ess settin’ by my ole man, wid her deliky
han’ on his fo’head. An’ I went, an’ ’gan fo’ to make
up de ole madam’s bed, an’ put her yoom to yights.
An’ all de time I was a-doin’ ob it I yeard de mummerin’
ob deir woices in de yudder yoom, but couldn’
year wot dey was a-sayin’. An’ sometimes I yeerd a
moan, but didn’t dare fo’ to ’trude ’fo’ I was called.
An’ arter I had done de ole madam’s yoom I went an’
wash up all de breakfas’ t’ings an’ clean up de kitchen.
’Deed, by dat time, I frought it weer time fo’ dem to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>call me in, ’specially as I didn’t year no mo’ talkin’.
W’en I were done cleanin’ up I went close to de do’
an’ listened, but couldn’ year nuffin, but ebery little
while a moan, like some one in deep ’stress. Well,
young marse, I waited ebber so long, an’ as nuffin
could be yeard but dat moanin’, moanin’, I got ’larmed,
an’ I jus’ peeped in’ an’ den I went in——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here suddenly the poor woman broke into a storm
of sobs and tears, throwing her apron over her head,
and rocking herself to and fro.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt did not attempt to comfort her. He did
not know how. He could only say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very sorry for you, Martha—very sorry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tain’t no use, young marster,” she said, as soon
as she had recovered her voice amid subsiding sobs
and tears. “’Tain’t a bit ob use! Me cryin’ nor yo’
bein’ sorry; not a bit ob use in dis worl’. ’Twon’t
change nuffin as is past an’ gone. Dere, I’s done now,”
she added, wiping her eyes with her checked apron.
“An’ now I’ll tell yo’ wot I foun’ w’en I went in dat
yoom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t hurry or distress yourself, Martha,” said
Harcourt kindly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mought’s well tell, an’ be done wiv it. Well,
young marse, w’en I went inter dat yoom I foun’ ole
mist’ess kneel in’ down on he flo’ by de side ob de bed,
wiv her head bowed down on de quilt, an’—an’—an’
my po’ ole man—dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another wild burst of sobs and tears interrupted
the narrative.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt could only repeat the words that rose sincerely
from his heart:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very, very sorry for you, poor, dear Martha.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dere, I didn’t fink as I was gwine to ’ave so bad
as dis. I didn’, fo’ a fac’. It ain’t no use, I know,
but I can’t help ob it, young marse. I can’t, indeed,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it, poor soul. Don’t try to tell me any
more to-night,” said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but I mus’. Young marse, it were de ole
madam wat was moanin’. My po’ ole man—bress his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>heart!—were pas’ all dat. He were layin’ dere, peaceable
as a sleepin’ baby. I heaved a prayer up to de
Lord, an’ den I jus’ kiss my po’ ole man, I did, an’
den I took hol’ ob de mist’ess’ han’, I did, an’ she
a-moanin’ low, an’ lif’ her up an’ sipport her wiv bofe
arms, an’ lead her out inter her own yoom, an’ set
her down in her own cha’, an’ she a-moanin’ an’
a-moanin’. I couldn’ speak, young marse; not den I
couldn’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can well believe it,” said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I couldn’t say nuffin. I could on’y keep on
heavin’ prayers out’n my heart up to de Lord. But de
ole madam, she speak fus’. I doane b’liebe she
knowed as my po’ ole man was gone, ’caze she said,
my ole mist’ess, she said, wiv her eyes up:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh, de disg’ace, Marfar! Oh, de disg’ace as has
fall on me in my ole age. I’s bore sorrow an’ poverty
an’ bereabement wivout murmurin’, but dis is wuss
dan all de res’. Oh, de disg’ace! disg’ace!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt turned very pale. What was this that
his mother had heard from her dying servant? Was
it—could it be that the old man had become acquainted
with the secret of the Isle of Storms? And how
could this have happened except through the treachery
of Hanson?</p>

<p class='c009'>“What,” he faltered, “what was this secret Moses
told my mother that caused her such anguish?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She nebber tole me, young marse, an’ I had too
much ’spec’ fo’ her to ax questions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt wrung his hands together as they lay on
his knees, and set his teeth to keep down, if possible,
all utterance of the agony that tortured his heart.
The next words of the woman reassured him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, she nebber give no word, de ole mist’ess didn’t,
ob what de trubble yeally was. But she kept on
sayin’:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh, de disg’ace! de disg’ace! Wot will my son
say if he year ob it? Wot will my high-speeryitted,
hono’ble Will say to dis dishonor as has fall on us?
Wot will he say? Oh, I hope he will nebber, nebber
year ob it!’”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“So,” thought Harcourt, with a sigh of relief, “it
is not the secret of the Crest House suicide that has
been told my mother. But what can it be? What
disgrace, in heaven’s name, could have come to us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So she kep’ on moanin’ an’ moanin’, ’til at las’
she seem to take frought, an’ she say, my ole mist’ess
say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Po’ ole Moses, he meant well; he did it all fo’
me! Go to him, Marfar, an’ tell him dat I freely fo’gibs
him, for I do.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat was de way, young marse, as I knowed she
didn’t know as my po’ ole man were gone. Yo’ see,
arter hearin’ the wuss she mus’ a drop yight down
by de bed w’ere I foun’ her, an’ kivered up her head,
an’ never moved ’til I come an’ helped her up an’ took
her out, an’ so she nebber knowed w’en my po’ ole
angel breaved his las’. He mus’ ’a’ ’parted berry
peaceful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Martha stopped, wiped away a few quiet tears, and
resumed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ’suaded my ole mist’ess to lay down, an’ den I
made her a cup o’ tea an’ gib her, an’ at las’ I went
to my po’ ole man to set long ob him an’ hab my cry
out, ’caze I was fillin’ up an’ chokin’ all de time de
ole madam was talkin’ an’ moanin’, an’ I didn’t wan’
to let out ’fo’ her. Dat arternoon I did my las’ dooty
to my po’ ole man. Dere wa’n’t nobody to do nuffin
dat day but me. An’ ef dere’d bin frousan’s, I wouldn’
’a’ let anybody tech my po’ ole angel but me—no,
sah, I wouldn’—not ’til de man wid de coffin came,
I wouldn’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you were alone there with your mistress, without
any help?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sah, ’til Mr. Silence Wyn’op come. Some ob
dem w’ite folks used to come ebery day. Dey was
moughty good to me w’ile my po’ ole man was sick,
yit’ letters fo’ me an’ sent good tings to eat fo’ him.
Yes, dey did. Dat ebenin’ Mr. Silence he come, an’
w’en he fin’ how it all was yere, he tuk all de ’sponsibility
on hisse’f, young Mr. Silence did, an’ had
eberyting ’tended to, he did—young Mr. Silence did—an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>my po’ ole angel had as ’spectable a funeral as
I could wish—yes, he had. An’ he’s gone to glory,
’caze he were a good angel, an’ nebber frought ’bout
hisse’f—no, sah, he didn’t. An’ he’s gone to glory,
an’ I won’t be long ’hind him—dat’s wot comfo’ts me
mos’ ob all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And your mistress?” inquired Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, w’en I tell her my po ’ole man were gone she
were berry sorry—berry sorry fo’ him an’ berry sorry
fo’ me, an’ moughty good she was to me; but she
nebber lef’ her bed, de ole madam didn’. Eben fo’
de fun’al she seem perfec’ly ’x’austed, an’ she did
nuffin but moan an’ groan, an’ mutter ’bout disg’ace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet you told me in the beginning of your talk
about her that she was happier now than she had
been since the death of my father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, young marster. I ’xplain ’bout dat p’esently.
But dat time w’en she lay in bed, moanin’ an’ groanin’
was las’ November, an’ dis is March. Dat time she
did nuffin but griebe ober wot she called disg’ace an’
shame, ’til I frought she would ’a’ died, or loss her
min’, I did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she never dropped a hint of the nature of
the secret she had heard from Moses?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nebber, young marse, f’om dat day to dis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was it——” slowly began Harcourt, as his mind
doubtfully and painfully reverted to the Crest House
tragedy—“was it anything of recent occurrence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Currants? No, young marse, ’twan’t nuffin ’bout
no currants, do’ I did take all I wanted fo’ de ole
madam’s jelly, out’n our ole garden up to de big house,
it was wid de w’ite people’s leabe; no, sah, ’twan’t
de currants.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mistake me; I mean to ask if this secret, told
by Moses to his mistress, was about anything that
happened lately—within the last six months, for instance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’, no, young marse! but years an’ years ago,
f’om de time de ole house an’ furnitur’ was sold ober
ole mist’ess’s head to dese p’esents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What could it have been, this disgrace to the family,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>unknown to my mother until it was revealed by
Moses? Have you no idea at all of its nature, Martha?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, young marse, I has had my ’spicions, an’ I’s
had ’em f’om de fus’, an’ dey’s growed stronger since
my po’ ole man went to glory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What were your suspicions?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, young marse, dough I nebber breaved dem
to no libin’ soul, I do yeckon as I ought fo’ to tell yo’,
seein’ as yo’ is de head ob de family like, arter de ole
madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it is certainly your duty to let me know the
truth about this alleged disgrace,” said Harcourt
solemnly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, young marse,” exclaimed Martha, firing up,
“I wan’ yo’ to understan’ one fing, fus’ off, as I nebber
said it were no disg’ace, an’ nebber ’liebed it to be
no disg’ace, an’ no sin, an’ no shame, an’ no yong done
to nobody in dis worl’. Dat’s wot I nebber b’liebes it
not to be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why should it have distressed my mother and
hurt poor, dear old Moses’ conscience?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’y, Lor’, Marster Will! Yo’ been to collidge, an’
doane know how some people’s conshence—an’ good
people’s conshence—ain’t got yight good sense. Some
people’s conshence won’t let ’em go to a dancin’ party,
an’ some odder people’s conshence won’t let ’em eat
meat o’ Fyday! An’ so it go. Now, my po’ ole man’s
conshence had a sort o’ saf’enin’ ob de brain—it was
dat tender. He would nebber hab done wot he did,
dough it were not yong, ’cept as he ’sidered ob it,
on’y fo’ de ole madam’s sake. Ah! he would ’a’ gibben
his soul as well as his body fo’ de ole mist’ess’s
sake, wot he nebber would ’a’ done to save me f’om
starvin’—dough I ’peat, it was no yong, ’cept as his
saf’ conshence ’sidered it. He nebber did no yong in
al de days ob his life. He were too good fo’ dis worl’,
my po’ ole man were, bress his heart,” said Martha,
again wiping away the intrusive tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Moses was a good man, one of the very best
I ever knew in all my life, but still that which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>did, whatever it was, was not only wrong in his eyes,
but in those of his mistress, else she could not have
been so distressed,” said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, she could, young marse. It was her
pwide, an’ her pwide had no mo’ sense in it dan my
ole man’s conshence. Her pwide had saf’enin’ ob de
brain wus’n his conshence!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, but what was it? What did Moses do?”
rather impatiently demanded Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I gwine tell yo’, young marse, yight now. Yo’
know w’en we-dem all lib up in de big house in de
good ole time ’fo’ de wah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yo’ was a b’y den, but still yo’ muss’ ’member how
Moses were dinin’-yoom sarvint, an’ how he had charge
ob all de silber in de house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Berry well, den. An’ yo’ ’members de time w’en
de sale were?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was in college then, and knew nothing of it until
I came home, to find my mother turned out of house
and home, and having her only shelter in this poor
hut.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So yo’ was, young marse, an’ so yo’ did. Well,
jus’ ’fo’ de crash come, an’ w’en we fus’ knowed it
was comin’, wot yo’ fink my po’ ole man did?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. What did he do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In de dead o’ night he tuk all ob de silberware—de
big tea tray an’ teapot an’ coffee pot, an’ de urn
an’ de sugar bowl, an’ de punch bowl, an’ tankards,
an’ goblets, an’ spoons an’ forks, an’ sugar tongs, an’
ebery singly fing, an’ totes ’em up de hill inter de big
woods, far f’om any yoad or paff, an’ buries ob ’em
in a deep hole he had dug, an’ covers ob ’em up, an’
covers de top ob de place wid dried leabes an’ sticks
an’ fings, to ’ceal de new turned up yeth. Dere! dat’s
wot my ole man did, an’ he did it fo’ de ole mist’ess,
not fo’ hisse’f.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you must have known of this act as well as
suspected it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look yere, young marse, I knowed ’bout dat buried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>silber all de time, not as my ole man eber tol’ me, fo’
he didn’t; but I foun’ out—nebber min’ how, at present,
but I foun’ out. But, Lor’, sah, I nebber, nebber
frought as dat was wot de po’ ole man had on his
conshence. I didn’t ’sider dat to ’mount to anyfing.
No, sah. It’s on’y lately as I knowed it was nuffin
’tall but de buried silber.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the sale was no inquiry made for the silver?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, marse. One ob de men did ’quire fo’ it,
an’ sent fo’ my ole man to gib ’count ob it, an’ dat
stranger f’om de Norf he say to my ole man:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Is yo’ de butler?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ my ole man answer back:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘No, sah, my name ain’t Butler, nor likewise nuffin
else but Moses Mungumbry, sah.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den dat w’ite man f’om de Norf he laugh out loud,
an’ say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Well, yo’ de man-servant ob de house, anyway.
Now, w’ere’s de silber?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den my ole man tell a pious frode, he did, fo’ ole
mist’ess’s sake, an’ say, he say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘De silber, sah? De silber hab gone de way ob all
flesh, an’ been sol’ off little by little, long ago—long
’fo’ de morgidge gib a lean on to de lan’. Yes, sah, it
went to pay debts, an’ to buy sugar an’ tea an’ sperrets
fo’ de ole madam.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where was your mistress when this conversation
took place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her had come to dis cabin airley in de mornin’,
’fo’ dem furriners f’om de Norf come, her had. She
didn’t wan’ to see ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes—of course. I might have known she was
not there. She might have been questioned, and she
would surely have contradicted Moses, and insisted on
the silver being produced.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; so she would. Dem w’ite men f’om de
Norf knowed dat, too, ’caze dey ax w’ere she war; an’
my ole man sweared his soul to Satan as she had
gone to Washington city on a visit to de Presiden’.
An’ den dey tackled me, an’ cross question ob me like
a murder trial. But dey didn’ get nuffin out’n me—no,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>sah! I were a better han’ at pi’us frodes dan my
ole man, an’ I sweared my soul to partition as all de
silber had been sol’ fo’ ’visions in de wah, an’ I didn’
fink no harm o’ tellin’ pi’us frodes to dem heethun fo’
my ole mist’ess’s sake. My conshence has got good
sense, it has. Well, dey s’arched up, an’ dey s’arched
down, but, Lor’, dey couldn’ fin’ nuffin. An’ wa’n’t I
glad! An’ me an’ my ole man look at one anodder,
an’ he look werry onhappy. His conshence wa’n’t
sensible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt said nothing to try to enlighten Martha’s
mind on this subject. He knew it would be of no
earthly use.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a pause Martha resumed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sah, w’en eberyt’ing got settled down, an’
de Wyn’ops bought de ole house an’ lan’, an’ mos’ ob
de furnitur’, an’ we was tryin’ to make ole mist’ess
comfo’table in de cabin——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t you get somebody to write to me?”
Harcourt interrupted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ole mist’ess wouldn’ year to it. She say, ole mist’ess
say, yo’ wasn’ to know nuffin ’tall ’bout de sale,
fear yo’d come yunnin’ yere ’fo’ yo’ tarm was out. She
yighted letters to yo’ ebery week, didn’t she? I
knowed she sent letters to de pos’ office at Logwood
ebery free four days by my ole man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, she wrote to me, but she never told me of
the change; nor did I hear of it until I came home
that summer vacation. But go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was gwine to say, young marse, ef it hadn’t been
fo’ dat hidden silber, ole mist’ess would ’a’ suffered
want. Yes, sah, she would! My po’ ole man were
’ployed cart drivin’ fo’ de Wyn’ops, but dough dey
paid well, de work wa’n’t stiddy, an’ it wa’n’t ’nough
to keep ole mist’ess in comforts. So de silber was took
out’n its hole, little by little, in de dead ob night, an’
sol’ to buy ’visions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did Moses manage to dispose of it without
detection?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, easy. My ole man had been sent two or free
times wid a pass f’om ole mist’ess, to sell a silber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>goblet or tankard, or sumfin, to a silbersmiff wot she
knowed in Wichmon’, an’ de silbersmiff knowed my
ole man was her faifful, trus’ful sarvan’, an’ he was
used to dealin’ long ob him, an’ so po’ ole Moses had
no trubble. He nebber telled me; but, Lor’! I could
see frough it all. He used to take a night, an’ go an’
get a silber teapot or sumfin out’n de hole in de woods,
an’ den he’d take a day an’ yide to Wichmon’ in de
steam keers, an’ sell de fing, woteber it mought be,
to dat silbersmiff wot knowed him, an’ knowed ole
mist’ess; and I don’t b’liebe dat silbersmiff nebber
fought dat ole mist’ess nebber sent dat silber to be
sol’, like she had sent de odder. An’ so we kep’ de
ole madam in comfo’t, wid de bes’ ob tea an’ coffee an’
w’ite sugar an’ pote wine an’ F’ench b’andy, an’ eberyt’ing
she wan’ to eat an’ d’ink.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then that is the secret which Moses on his deathbed
told my mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, young marster, dat must ’a’ been it, ’caze dere
wan’ nuffin else fo’ to tell. ’Sides w’ich, I knowed
it prayed on to his po’ ole min’, ’caze he use to talk
in his sleep ’bout it. Dat ’firmed me in my ’spicions.
An’, young marse, de ole madam ain’t been herse’f—not
jes’ her own se’f, ebber since.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor mother! Poor lady! But you said she was
happy now. How comes that? And how comes it,
also, that she is at Lone Lodge on a visit?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She ain’t dere on a wisit, young marse. She is
dere at home, perminicy, an’ dat wot it is make her
so happy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! What is this you tell me? That my mother,
my proud, high-spirited mother, stoops to be dependent
on the Wynthrops for a home? And is even
happy in such dependence?” exclaimed Harcourt, in
humiliated and indignant amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, youg marse, sah, doane yo’ go off at sich a
tanger! Let me ’xplain. De ole madam kep’ on griebin’
an’ griebin’ ’bout dat disg’ace, as she call it, till
she got yight down weak an’ low——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor lady! poor lady!” murmured Harcourt in a
low tone.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“An’ so it went on ’til one night dere comed up de
awfulles’ win’ storm as ebber yo’ saw in all de days
ob yo’ life! An’ yo’d fink de hills yere would ’a’ ’tected
us, but dey didn’ much, ’caze dat win’ swurl in at
de low en’ ob de walley an’ up to de high en’, fo’ all
de worl’ like de draft ob one of dem stobes dey Wyn’ops
got up at de big house. We didn’t go to bed dat
night, an’ well we didn’, de ole madam an’ me, fo’ in
de middle ob de night de win’ come whurlin’ up de
walley an’ twissed de ruff yight off de top ob de cabin
an’ whurled it up to de odder en’ ob de walley, an’
hev it down. An’ we was unruffed in de middle ob
de night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt shuddered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did my poor mother do?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nuffin. She couldn’ do nuffin. I made her a narrow
bed out ob bolsters an’ pillows on de flo’, an’ put
her on it, an’ kivered her up, an’ den tuk de big kitchen
table an’ stood it up ober her, an’ hung quilts an’
blankets ober dat to keep off de win’ an’ de rain, wot
soon poured down like No’s flood. Oh, young marse,
dat was de wus’ night I ebber see in all my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And your poor mistress?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, young marse, next mornin’ de sto’m was ober,
an’ de sun shinin’ an’ smilin’, good-natured as a angel,
on to our wracked an’ ruinated home. An’ ’deed anybody
not intrusted mought even ’a’ laughed—de place
did look dat queer, wid eberyt’ing all yight, ’cept ’twas
de ruff off, an’ de yooms all open to de sky, an’ po’ ole
mist’ess tucked up unnerneaf ob de table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think it was no laughing matter,” said
Harcourt, in grave rebuke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No mo’ it wa’n’t, young marse—’deed wa’n’t it!
De po’ ole mist’ess was berry ill—in a high feber—doane
be scared, young marse! Yo’ know, I telled
yo’ she were well an’ happy now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on,” was all that Harcourt found it possible to
say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t know wot to do. I was ’fraid to leabe ole
mist’ess, an’ ’fraid not to run fo’ ’sistance. Anyway,
dem Wyn’ops up to de big house was lookin’ out wid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>a spyglass at de damage done by dat darnado, an’
dey see de ruff offen our cabin, an’ dey sent young
Mr. Silence down yere to see arter us. Oh, young
marse, dem Norfen furriners is good people, fo’ w’en
dey see de trouble we was in, an’ de ole mist’ess in a
high feber, an’ ’tirely out’n her head, they sent a
kivered wagon down yere an’ had her lif’ into it, bed
an’ all, an’ dey carry her up to de big house, an’ tell
me to come along, too, till de ruff was put on de cabin
again. An’ dat was de way de ole mist’ess come to
be up at de big house as was once her own home—not,
as I b’liebe she would ebber hab gone inter dat
house ef she hadn’t been out’n her head.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I am sure she would not,” sighed poor Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I mus’ say it was a bressed fing as she did go,
young marse. It saved her life. An’ w’ere does yo’
tink dey put de ole madam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the back building, or in the garret?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sah! Dey put her in bed in her own bressed
ole yoom—de parlor bedyoom, w’at opens offen de
drawin’-yoom on one side an’ de back piazza on de
t’oder! Yes, sah, dey put her dere, an’ it were jus’
as she lef’ it free years ago. Same flowered chintz
bed curt’ins, an’ same windy curt’ins. Yes, an’ same
rag carpet as I helped to make myself! Same corner
cupboard, an’ same armchair wid same patchwork
cushions on it. Yes, sah, it were. An’ dey put de
ole madam in it, jus’ de same as if she had nebber
lef’ it. Yes, sah, I did ax Miss Mar’get, wot is a werry
nice young w’ite gal, how it war, an’ she tell me her
mudder like dat yoom so w’en she fus’ see it she
wouldn’ hab nuffin change’ into it, but kep’ it for
comp’ny jus’ so. An’ dey put ole mist’ess inter it.
Now wot does yo’ tink ob dat fo’ de Wyn’ops?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was very, very kind; still, I don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’y? Yo’ ought ter like it, young marse. Yo’
oughtn’ ter let pwide come in yere. An’ dey sent fo’
Dr. Wall to ’tend her, and arterward Dr. Lat’rop, f’om
Logwood. An’ dere war me s’eepin’ on a little mattrass
on de flo’ ’fo’ de fire, like I used to do w’enebber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>de ole madam was poorly, an’ wanted ob me. Oh, it
war like de good ole times, it war! An’ de ole madam
got perfec’ly well an’ happy—well, dat is ’cept fo’ one
’lusion she has on to her min’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Delusion?” inquired Harcourt uneasily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sah. Dat’s wot de Wyn’ops call it—’lusion.
An’ it’s dat ’lusion wot makes her so happy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” demanded Harcourt anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, young marse! I can’t help larfing an’ cryin’
bofe w’en I fink ob it. Dat feber ob hers it wipe out
all de sorrows an’ sufferin’s as my ole mist’ess eber
had in her life. It wipe out de bloody wah, an’ de deaf
ob de ole marse, an ’de young ge’man an’ young ladies,
an’ de sale ob de house an’ lan’, an’ de po’ libin’ in
de log cabin, an’ eberyt’ing. W’en ole mist’ess come
out ob dat feber, an’ wake up in her ole yoom, she
t’ought how she had nebber lef’ it. She t’ought de
ole marse an’ de young chillun was all libin’, an’—an’
she t’ought dat all de Wyn’ops in de house war
her own comp’ny.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Insane! Oh, my poor mother!” groaned Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doane take it dat way, young marse! De ole
madam is sensible as a judge in eberyt’ing else but
dat ’lusion, an’ dat ’lusion do make her so happy yo’
oughtn’ ter begrudge it to her. An’ de Wyn’ops, dey
do humor her into it, an’ dey tell me ebery day not
fo’ de worl’ to counterdick her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that she should be living in dependence on
these people!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tain’t quite dat, neider, young marse. Dere’s
money comes ter her ebery once in a w’ile—f’om some
’un or odder who owed ole marse a debt. It come
frough some laayer, in de care ob Miss Mar’get, an’
she do lay it out fo’ de ole madam. I know she pay
de two doctah’s bills an’ bought fings wid it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” said Harcourt. “I believe I did hear from
mother that there was an old debt owed her which
was to be paid by installments. But if mother stays
there I must pay her board. If the people won’t take
pay she must come away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, she mus’n’, ’deed, young marster. It would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>kill her. ’Sides w’ich, I doane b’liebe dese sens’ble
Norvun people would ’ject to yo’ payin’ bo’d fo’ her.
Dey ain’t got none ob dat nasty se’fish pwide wot
won’t take no ’sideration on ter nobody e’se’s pwoper
pwide. No, sah! Now, young marse, p’ease tell me
wot o’clock it is. It mus’ be gettin’ moughty late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no watch, Martha, but I should judge it
to be about ten o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“See dat now! I mus’ go back ter ole mist’ess. I
s’eeps in her yoom ebery night, to take care ob her.
I does fo’ her all day, too, dough I keeps on dis ole
cabin to keep my fings in; an’ young marse, I kin mak’
yo’ mons’ous comfo’ble in de oder yoom, w’ere ole
mist’ess used to s’eep, ef yo’ doane min’ s’eepin’ yere
ter-night. De ruff doane let in no water, eben if de
rain come, dough it is men’ed moughty rough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall sleep here, if you please, so long as I stay
in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All yight, young marse. I’ll do de bes’ I kin fo’
yo’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Martha went into the other room, made the bed,
laid out towels, and filled the pitcher with fresh
water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she returned, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, young marse, yo’ll be comfo’ble fo’ de night,
an’ airly ter-morrer mornin’, fo’ ole mist’ess wake up.
I’ll yun down yere an’ git yo’ breakfas’ yeddy. Good-night,
young marse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night. But how will you get into the house
without disturbing the family?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I got de key ob de ole mist’ess’s yoom, wot
open on de piazza. I allers comes in an’ out ob dat
do’, an’ not de one wot opens on to de parlor. Good-night,
sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Martha had left the cabin Harcourt started
up and followed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot de matter, young marse?” she inquired, turning
back when she heard him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not tell your mistress that I have returned.
Wait until I go to the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Course I won’t, young marse. It would mak’ her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>too res’less ’til she seed yo’,” answered Martha, and
she turned again and hurried up the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt stood looking around him on the night
scene, and meditating on all that he had heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>The March wind was still blowing, driving ragged
black clouds across the expanse of sky above, and
swaying the pine trees on the top of the hills around.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was he glad or sorry that his mother was an honored
guest at Lone Lodge, humored in the delusion
that repossessed her of all her lost treasures of husband
and children, home and wealth, and made her
completely happy?</p>

<p class='c009'>He found it impossible to answer that question
until he should have seen and talked with Dorothy
Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>But of one other circumstance he was deeply glad
and grateful—that Roma was free! Come what might
to himself now, Roma was free!</p>

<p class='c009'>He wondered whether Martha or any of the people
at Lone Lodge or at Logwood knew anything about
the motive of his mother’s sudden journey to Washington
city, when she went to attend his hasty marriage,
or whether any of them knew anything about
the ceremony that had been performed at the little
church at the dawn of day, or even anything about
his engagement to Roma Fronde. He had been anxious
to ascertain, but could not, even indirectly, ask
the question; for if Martha knew nothing about the
circumstances such inquiry would start speculation,
if it did not give information.</p>

<p class='c009'>He thought, on the whole, that no one in the neighborhood
knew anything about the matter. His mother
was proud and reserved, and would not be likely, under
her circumstances, to speak of family affairs to
any one there, and so she had gone to Washington
city without telling any one why she went there.</p>

<p class='c009'>On her return she might have told Martha, had not
the exigent and exciting events that met her in the
cabin delayed the communication until she was prostrated
by the severe fever that burned all memory of
recent events out of her brain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>True, the letters that he had received with partial
news of his mother were all directed to Snowden,
which would seem to prove that the writer, Margaret
Wynthrop, had reason to suppose that he was at the
Isle of Storms, where he was believed to have gone
to spend his honeymoon with Roma Fronde. Yet no
mention of Roma Fronde—no allusion to his supposed
marriage, occurred in any of the letters. Possibly,
Margaret Wynthrop had directed his letters there as
to the place of the last address she knew of when he
was clerk of the Crest House. Yes, that must have
been the reason. And she knew nothing of his marriage;
and his mother, in her happy delusion, had
forgotten it, with everything else that had happened
in the last few years. Still, he could not feel quite
certain of his theories until he should have seen his
mother and met the Wynthrops.</p>

<p class='c009'>At least one thing seemed assured—that he would
be asked no questions about his lost Roma, and that
would relieve him from much dreaded embarrassment.
He would have no bitter, grievous explanations to
make, or invent, for the absence of his supposed bride;
no deception, justifiable or otherwise, to practice upon
his aged mother, no new sin, the necessary outcome
of the old sin, to burden his conscience. His aged
mother was happy in a paradise of illusions. Before
long she would leave that for a heaven of realities.
When that time should come, and she should be safe
beyond the possibility of knowing or sharing his
shame and agony, he would give himself up to justice
for his share in the tragedy at the Crest House,
and he would tell Roma of the dire need, the infernal
scourge of fire, that had driven him to wrong her
as he had done. She would forgive him, and he would
meet his fate in State prison or on the scaffold, whichever
it might be, with more patience and fortitude
than he possessed now in bearing the weight of memory
and remorse.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be a dark ending of all his bright aspirations
for the honor of this world, but then he had
done with this world—and there was another—a world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>free from temptation and sin, full of love and faith;
there he should meet again all whom he had loved
and lost, and best of all—Roma! And nothing would
be between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>While he walked slowly up and down the little,
narrow space between the cabin and the stream, meditating
on the troubled past and threatening future,
the wind had gradually cleared the sky overhead and
had sunk into rest. The pine trees stood still, the
stars shone out, all was quiet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The storm clouds are breaking—a little, a little—even
for me,” he said. “But it will never be clear in
this world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned and went into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found the room once occupied by his mother
very comfortably arranged for his accommodation. A
good fire was blazing in the chimney, and on the
hearth before it was a pitcher of chocolate kept warm
for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He drank its contents gratefully and went to rest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='c007'>HARCOURT AT LONE LODGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The profound quiet of the little vale, the soothing
tinkle of the little stream, lulled the wearied traveler
into a slumber so deep and prolonged that the sun
was high above before he woke.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then it took him a few minutes to collect his faculties
and realize his position. He looked with something
like a faint content on the humble, peaceful
scene around him. He lay for a little while in a sort
of restful trance, and then suddenly remembered all
that he had heard from Martha on the previous night
about his mother’s state, and he sprang out of bed
and dressed in haste, so that he might the sooner see
that beloved parent and judge for himself of her
condition.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>When he had hurried through his plain toilet he
opened his room door and crossed the narrow passage
into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>There he found no one present, though every preparation
was completed for his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a glorious wood fire in the wide, open
chimney, and bright tin-covered dishes sitting on the
stone hearth before it; a pine table laid with a fine,
white, well darned damask cloth—a vestige of better
days at Lone Lodge, like the rare and costly, but
chipped and mismatched old china that adorned it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt understood the situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Martha, true to her word, had come very early in
the morning, before her mistress would be likely to
wake and want her services, and finding that her
young master still slept, she had forborne to disturb
him, but had gone quietly to work to prepare his
morning meal, which she had placed before the fire
to be kept hot until he should rise and require it,
while she herself hurried back to Lone Lodge to attend
upon her mistress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt placed his breakfast on the table and sat
down to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>While he was slowly sipping his coffee he heard
rapid, scuttling footsteps tearing through the brushwood
toward the cabin, and the next moment the door
was pushed open and Martha ran in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” she exclaimed, out of breath, and stopping
short on seeing Harcourt. “So yo’s up, young marse.
Hopes yo’ had a good night’s rest, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The best I have had for many a day, Martha, thank
you,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See dat now! Comin’ home, dat’s wot it is; natyve
air, an’ dat. ’Scuse me, young marse, an’ let me sit
down, wiv yo’ ’mission. I’s sort o’ out o’ breaf, yunnin’
so fas’,” panted the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, good Martha; make yourself comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hopes yo’ fin’s yo’ breakfas’ good an’ yelishin’,
young marse,” said the cook, as she modestly sat down
on the cricket.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“The best breakfast, as well as the best night’s rest,
I have had for many a day. Your coffee and your
butter and your rolls cannot be surpassed,” said Harcourt
heartily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“P’oud ter hear yo’ say so, sah—but,” she inquired,
dubiously, and ravenous for praise, like all her race,
“anyfing de matter wid de ham or de hominy or de
sweet taters, or de fr’ed chicken?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no. They are all delicious—perfectly delicious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Moughty p’oud ter year yo’ say so, sah, moughty
p’oud.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Martha, I have been longing to ask you how
is your mistress? Well, this morning, I hope, by your
manner?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“P’opper well, sah. Peert as pussy, de ole madam
is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did not tell her that I had come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hi! young marse, who yo’ fink is a fool? Not me!
No, sah, I didn’t tell de ole madam, who was as’eep
up yere in de log house. If I had, dere wouldn’ been
no holdin’ her back, no, sah. She’d ’a’ t’ied to walk
down herse’f.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My poor, dear mother! How soon now can I see
her, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soon’s ebber yo’ like, sah. De ole madam hab
finis’ her breakfas’—an’ doane she yeat hearty?
Umph! umph! It would do yo’ good ter see her,” said
Martha, smacking her own lips in gastronomic sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt was not pleased to be told this. He had
heard that abnormal appetite often attended cases of
softening of the brain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ now,” continued Martha, “she is sot down to
her stockin’ an’ ball o’ yarn, an’ she knittin’ away like
a cherrybim. Yo’ can go see her soon’s ebber yo’s
done yo’ breakfas’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have done my breakfast, and I will go at once,”
said Harcourt; and he arose quickly and hurried into
the bedroom to get his overcoat—the handsome one
he had worn on his defeated wedding tour, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>carefully preserved that he might appear well dressed
in the presence of his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wan’ me ter go long o’ yo’, young marse?” inquired
Martha when he re-entered the kitchen, ready
for his walk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I wish you to go before me to your mistress,
and tell her I am there—close by. I do not wish to
take her quite by surprise. And besides, as a matter
of imperative courtesy, I must present myself to her
kind hostess on first going to the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sartin, young marse; dat is true. An’ ’deed, dey’s
all been moughty good to de ole madam—Lor’ knows
dey has—moughty good,” said Martha, as she wrapped
her tall figure in a large black shawl and put a quilted
black silk hood on her head, for the walk with the
young master. They left the cabin together, Martha
just closing the door, which had neither lock nor bolt,
only a light latch to keep it shut in windy weather,
for there were no thieves on this old plantation, and
the cabin was remote from thoroughfares.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up the little, narrow, almost invisible footpath over
the wooded hill they went until they came in view
of Lone Lodge, a large, rambling, picturesque old
farmhouse, built partly of gray stone, partly of red
bricks, and partly of wood. It consisted of three distinct
houses, the growth of generations, and was
joined together after a fashion, or rather after no
fashion at all. The oldest and rudest part of the building
was also the strongest and quaintest; but the later
structures were in a good state of preservation. There
were broad piazzas front and back, both roofed over,
and there were porticoes, balconies and bay windows
stuck on here and there, up and down the wall at each
gable end. The roofs of the buildings were of different
heights and shapes—the old colonial house had
a high, peaked roof, with dormer windows; the middle
edifice, built just after the close of the Revolutionary
War, had a hip roof, with two rows of tiny
windows; while the third building had a Mansard,
with its beautiful lights and trimmings.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Opening on the front piazza there were three doors,
leading into the three divisions of the triune house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt went up to the central door and knocked,
while Martha scuttled around to the rear to warn her
mistress of her son’s near presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>After some little delay the door was opened by
Margaret Wynthrop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Mr. Harcourt! How do you do? I am very
glad to see you! Mrs. Harcourt will be overjoyed,”
she said cordially.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am here to thank you for your great goodness to
my dear mother, though mere thanks, however earnest
and heartfelt, are but a poor return for such goodness,”
said the young man, with much emotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, indeed!” earnestly responded the girl, “it has
been a real satisfaction to us all to be permitted to
alleviate in some degree the troubles of this lady. But
pray come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He followed into the old familiar hall, with its
broad horsehair sofa and straight-backed chairs and
frescoed pictures above them, with its oaken doors
on either side, and its well-worn staircase in the
center.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no fire in the big parlor. Come in here,”
she said, and she opened a door on the left leading
into the family sitting-room, where Mrs. Wynthrop
and her second daughter, Elizabeth, were seated at
work.</p>

<p class='c009'>The elder lady was cutting and basting on a lapboard.
The younger one was thumping away at a
sewing machine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both arose and left their seats to welcome the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are very happy to see you, Mr. Harcourt.
This is my daughter Betty. I think you have never
met her before. Betty, dear, this is Mrs. Harcourt’s
son,” said Mrs. Wynthrop, cordially shaking hands
with the visitor, and presenting him to her younger
daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man bowed to the young girl, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>seemed in face and form only a fairer and more delicate
repetition of her mother and elder sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take this armchair in the chimney corner, Mr.
Harcourt,” said Margaret. “But take off your overcoat
first. Frankly, you are not looking in good health.
You must be careful of yourself at this season of the
year, when the changes are so sudden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt thanked his counselor, and obeyed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he was seated he again expressed his warm
gratitude to Mrs. Wynthrop for her kindness to his
aged and infirm mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Wynthrop, in turn, assured him of the pleasure
she and all her family had taken in doing all that they
had been able to do for Mrs. Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the house is so large. We have so much
space. Why, you know, of course, that we have three
distinct garrets, one over each part of this threefold
house. The two largest I had made into bedrooms
for the boys. They made four rooms. The smaller—which,
by the way, is large enough in all conscience—I
keep for our lumber room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our ‘chamber of desolation,’ I call it, Mr. Harcourt,”
said Betty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every house must have its ‘chamber of desolation,’”
added Mrs. Wynthrop, “but really, I think the
empty rooms are the most desolate of all. They are
like bodies without souls. And now that my three
youngest girls are at school at Northampton, two of
the younger lads at college, and two of the elder boys
have gone into the dry goods business in Washington
city, the old house is more than half unoccupied.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I proposed to mamma to take summer boarders
this season,” said Margaret with a light laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>And in this seeming jest the girl had a serious and
benevolent purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>She felt how necessary it was that the aged gentlewoman
should remain in peaceable possession of her
room and her illusions; and she knew enough of the
morbid pride and sensitiveness of the family to feel
that young Harcourt could never bend his spirit to
leave his infirm mother a dependent on their hospitality;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and also that he—judging them by himself—would
hesitate to propose to pay board for her, lest
he should give offense.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feeling and knowing all this, the kind-hearted and
practical girl prepared his way with a jest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without suspecting her humane purpose, he followed
immediately where she wished to lead, and said,
still with some faltering:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish—oh! I do wish—it would be such a blessing
to my dear mother—that you would take her as a
permanent boarder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Harcourt is most welcome to us. She will
always be welcome, either as a visitor or boarder,
whichever you please, and just as long as she likes.
She is so happy here in her old home,” said Mrs. Wynthrop
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, she is very happy here in her old home, and
in the delusion that it has never ceased to be her
home,” said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it would be a great pity to disturb her in that
delusion,” added the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I understand you, madam, and I thank you
more than words can convey. So long as I live——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatever the young man was going to add was cut
short by a rap, followed by the entrance of Martha,
who dropped her old-fashioned courtesy, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Scuse me, ladies, but de ole madam is gettin’ mons’ous
unpatient to see de young marster.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go to your mother at once, Mr. Harcourt. We
can talk afterward. Of course, you must make this
your home while you stay in the neighborhood. No,
not a word of objection now, but go,” said Mrs. Wynthrop
with authority.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt bowed, and obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Martha preceded him across the broad hall, into a
large front parlor, and through this to a rear door
communicating with what was now called the parlor
bedchamber, though formerly it had been only known
as “mother’s room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Martha paused, with her hand on the knob of the
lock, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Now, young marse, yo’ mus’n’t show no s’prise at
nuffin de ole madam say, nor likewise conterdic’ her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words, she opened the door.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='c007'>IN DOROTHY HARCOURT’S ROOM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was a large, square, low-ceiled, but light and
cheerful room, with two north windows looking out
upon a green and shaded lawn, now just beginning
to spring and bud with grass and blossoms which leaf
and flower in April, and two west windows, opening
on a back piazza, beyond which was the bleaching
ground, with the laundry and the summer kitchen in
the distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The four-post bedstead, with its blue chintz curtains,
in the corner, between the north and the west
windows; the tall chest of drawers, topped by its tall
looking-glass, that stood between the two north windows;
the two buffets, one on each side of the fireplace—that
on the right holding the household medicines
and cordials, that on the left the toilet service,
which, when in use, was placed upon its top; the deep
easy-chair by the side of the bed; the flag and cane
armchairs, with their quilted patchwork cushions; last
and best, the open wood fire, before which the old
lady now sat, with her knitting in her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>She wore a rusty black bombazine dress, with a
white muslin handkerchief crossed over her breast,
and a white net cap with black ribbon, above the
plainly parted gray hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as she heard the door open she turned
quickly around, and, seeing Harcourt, arose, trembling,
and tottered to meet him, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My own dear Will! I am so glad to see you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear mother!” he responded, with emotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he caught her in his arms and gently replaced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>her in the chair from which she had started to receive
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>But for his prompt action she might have sunk
to the floor, so weak she seemed, although he had
been told she was in such good bodily health. Yes;
and very pale and thin she looked, although he had
been informed that her appetite was so excellent.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stooped and kissed her, drew a chair to her side,
and sat down and took her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am so happy to be with you again, mother. And
you are happy here, are you not?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at him strangely for a moment, and
then answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, of course I am happy here, dear. Why
shouldn’t I be so? I have nothing to trouble me but
your long absences, and, of course, I know they are
necessary, and that you are doing well at the university.
It would be very selfish in me to wish to
keep you home, especially as I have all the rest of
them with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All the rest!” repeated Harcourt sadly, beginning
now, for the first time, to realize the delusion of his
mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear, they are all here. John did not go to
the Naval Academy, as he wished to do, nor Peyton
to West Point. The defeat of our party, and the total
change of administration prevented their success.
And I was not sorry. I would rather have them home,
for I am growing old, I am growing very old,” slowly
muttered the poor lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt suppressed a groan. He saw that the recent
past was totally obliterated from his mother’s
mind, which had gone back to the time before the
Civil War, and she talked of John and Peyton, both
of whom had fallen in battle, and whose bodies filled
unknown graves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am so pleased to have you here, my dear; but I
do not understand it. This is not vacation time. How
is it that you are able to leave the university in the
middle of the term?”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Harcourt was hesitating how to answer this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>question she put on her spectacles, took a good, deep
look at him, and then saved him the trouble of a reply
by saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, I see. Yes, I see. You have been studying
too hard—overworking yourself, and you have been
obliged to come home and take a rest. And you came
by the night train, and reached here only this morning,
did you not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, mother; I got here last night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Last night! Why did you not come to me at once?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You had retired to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you sleep?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In your old room at the cabin,” answered Harcourt,
thrown off his guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In—my—old—room—in—the—cabin! What on
earth do you mean, Will?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I mean, of course, in Martha’s best room in
her cabin, where she made me up a bed, so as to prevent
me from disturbing the family,” said Harcourt,
correcting himself as well as he could.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as if the return of one’s son at any hour of
the day or night would or could disturb his family!
Where did you get your breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Martha had an excellent breakfast waiting for me
in the cabin as soon as I rose in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should have slept here in your own old room
over mine, and have taken your breakfast with the
family. Will, do you know it was very eccentric in
you to do otherwise? And then, the idea of your saying
that you slept in my old room at the cabin! Will,
what put such a thing as that in your head, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not answer promptly. He was thinking what
he could say, and resolving to be very cautious in
future talks with his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at him very keenly, and then exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will, I see how it is. You have overworked your
poor brain. Your mind is unhinged, Will. You must
not go back to the university again until after the
summer vacation. You can put off getting your degree
for a year or two years. You are young enough
to wait, and I will not have you overworking your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>brain to a dangerous extent. I will speak to your
father about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My—father!” muttered poor Will, thinking of the
gallant soldier who fell fighting side by side with heroic
Stonewall Jackson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Have you seen your father this morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Will.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then he must be in the study, with the overseer
and the farm books, making out the first quarter of
the year; for it is near the first of April, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Harcourt helplessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, Will, you will have a gay time. The
house is full of company. Two of the loveliest girls
you ever saw, and two of the pleasantest young men,
and a very agreeable married couple. We are, every
one of us, charmed with them. And I am very glad
you have come to enjoy their company and help to entertain
them. I am well, but somehow or other I do
not seem to have any strength in my back or limbs,
and when I attempt to stand up I feel so uncertain on
my feet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Will understood this symptom but too well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so you see,” she continued, “I cannot do my
part toward entertaining our visitors as I could wish.
I have to leave almost everything to the girls and
boys. But they are all very happy together, I assure
you. Have you seen your brothers and sisters?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, mother,” sadly replied poor Will.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, I suppose the boys are in the fields
somewhere, and, of course, the girls are with our visitors,”
said the old lady, and she spoke so calmly and
so naturally that no one unacquainted with the circumstances
could possibly have suspected her perfect
sanity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems to me you have grown a great deal since
you went to college, Will,” she said, after a pause.
Some furtive ray of memory had vaguely suggested
that “Will” was a mere boy at the time which her
illusions had reproduced, and in which she now lived.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt knew not what to say better than this:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You think so, mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Why, I know so. You are quite a man now. You
will be falling in love with some of these pretty girl
visitors of mine presently. I wonder where those
sisters of yours can be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Where they can be? Long ago in the better world,
he hoped; but their bodies lay in the churchyard of
All Souls’ Parish, at Logwood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are with their visitors, I suppose, and cannot
leave; and perhaps they do not know that you
are here; for if they did I think they would come running
in anyhow—visitors or no visitors. Go find them,
dear. They will be so delighted to see you, and they
will introduce you to their young lady friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt got up, kissed the wrinkled forehead of
the aged woman, and with a deep sigh left the room,
passing into the front parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>There he found Martha waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot I tell yo’, young marse?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The truth, Martha, and a very distressing truth,”
he sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doane yo’ say dat, young marse. Her ’lusions
mak’ her so contented. An’ sometimes I doane fink
dey’s altogedder ’lusions, nudder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean, Martha?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sometimes I fink dey is ’bout her, sure ’nough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Martha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I do, young marse—sometimes! W’y, w’en I
year de ole madam talkin’ to de ole marster jus’ as
ef he were here p’esen’, I tell yo’ it do gimmy de
creeps! I feel like he were dere sure ’nough, on’y I
couldn’ see him. Trufe I’m tellin’ yo’ young marse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Martha, you must not give such reins to your imagination.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot dat yo’ say ’bout yain, young marse?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean to say you must not think so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t help ob it, sah. Now take tudder day. I
was stan’in’ up fo’ my mist’ess, a holdin’ o’ a hank o’
yarn, stretch out ober my han’s, w’en all ob a sudden
de ole madam take de hank offen my yists, an’ she say,
quiet as yo’ please, de ole mist’ess do:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“‘Dere’s yo’ marster, Marffy. Jaw de yockin-cha’
up to de fire fo’ him.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I look youn’, but dere was nobody in de
yoom but we two—de ole mist’ess an’ me. An’ she
say ’gain:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘W’y doane yo’ min’ wot I tell yo’, Marffy, ’oman?
Set a cha’ fo’ yo’ marster.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sah, I felt icicles meltin’ all ober my skin an’
tricklin’ down my backbone. Use as I were to de
ole madam’s queer ’lucinations, my ha’r riz dat time,
an’ my teef chattered. I felt jus’ as if a ghose was
dere, dough I couldn’ see him. But ole mist’ess look
at me stern like, an’ I took an’ push de cha’ up to de
fire, an’ ole mist’ess say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Set yo’ down dere, Everard. Dere, now! Put yo’
feet ter de fire—dat’s yight.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ den she began talkin’ ter him, an’ axin’ questions,
an’ ’peared to fink he answered back, dough I
heard no voice but hers, an’ likewise saw nobody but
her. An’ p’esently, ’pears like he riz to leab, ’case she
say, ole mist’ess did:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘W’ere yo’ goin’? Mus’ yo’ go? Oh, well, if yo’
hab all dat to do, of co’se you mus’, but come back
soon as yo’ get frough.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ den, in about de nex’ minute, ole mist’ess say
to me:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Marffy, put back yo’ marster’s cha’.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, young marse, I’d a yudder tetched a live yattlesnake
dan dat cha’ w’ere de ghose had set, but I
had to do it. So I prayed ef de Lord would spare
my life dat time I’d try to be a better ’oman. An’ I
push dat cha’ back sort ob gingerly, an’ all my flesh
creepin’ offen my bones. An’ yes, young marse, many
an’ many’s de time sence dat I hab had to wait on de
ghoses, as I couldn’ see! No, I couldn’t see, nor likewise
year! Tanks be to goodness fo’ dat much! Fo’
ef I had seed or yeard dem indiwisable fings I should
a-drap down dead! I know I should!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Martha, there is no reality in all this. They are
but the delusions, hallucinations of an infirm brain,”
said Harcourt gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Young marse, yo’ may call ’em ’lusions or ’lucinations,
or any fine name yo’ please, an’ so do I—sometimes—but
mos’ly I do call ’em by de name I knowed
’em by w’en I was a young ’oman. I calls ’em ghoses.
But dere! I mus’ ’liver Missus Wyn’op’s messidge.
She tell me to tell yo’, w’en yo’ come out, to come into
her yoom an’ see her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, I will go at once,” said the young man;
and leaving Martha to rejoin her mistress, who was
never left alone, he went directly to Mrs. Wynthrop’s
sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found the three tall, fair women employed as
they had been on his first call.</p>

<p class='c009'>They all left work and made him welcome to the
fireside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you find the dear mother?” inquired the
elder lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so well as I had been led to expect,” said
Harcourt with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, indeed, beyond the weakness of her limbs, due
to her one single malady, she has good health. She
never suffers in mind or body. She has a good appetite,
fine spirits, and she enjoys life oven more than
we do, I fancy. Think of that, Mr. Harcourt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—I know—but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she has her illusions, you mean to say? Well,
these illusions never disturb her; they soothe and satisfy
her. We should accept them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is she under medical treatment?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dr. Wall attended her during her severe illness,
and Dr. Lathrop was called in as consulting physician
when disease of the brain began to develop. Dr. Wall
has lately ceased his visits, as unnecessary, but Dr.
Lathrop comes two or three times a week. He has
retired from practice, but he comes to Mrs. Harcourt,
because he is something of a specialist on nerves and
brain, and also he comes to her for old neighborhood’s
sake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is his opinion of her condition?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He thinks that she requires only tonics, full nutrition,
fresh air, and such passive exercise as we can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>give her. He thinks that she may live many years
in this condition, but that her final recovery can
scarcely be hoped for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt sighed profoundly, and after some little
delay said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you pardon me, madam, if I venture to speak
of business?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a question! Of course, business must be
spoken of,” said the kindly but very practical hostess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then—during my mother’s illness there must have
been expenses—debts incurred—and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There were expenses, certainly, but there are no
debts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—do not understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let me explain. Margaret here is the medium
of correspondence between Mrs. Harcourt and her
Washington and Baltimore friends, and this began
from her writing a letter for old Moses to his mistress
when she was last in Washington.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was very kind of Miss Wynthrop. I heard of
it,” said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, she has been in correspondence with a certain
lawyer, Amos Merritt, of Washington, who forwards
from time to time money for an old debt due
by a Baltimorean to your father, and now being paid
by installments. The money is sent in checks, made
payable to Dorothy Harcourt. She is quite able to
write her autograph on the back, and with her indorsement
Margaret has got them cashed at the Logwood
bank, and has paid doctors’ and druggists’ bills,
and also some others. She has all the receipts, if you
would like to look at them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt’s face flamed. The idea of his requirement
of these receipts from such disinterested benefactors!</p>

<p class='c009'>“By no means, my dear madam! But since you
kindly give me permission, I would like to make some
arrangement for my dear mother’s permanent abode
with you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, talk to Margaret about it. She is my housekeeper,
accountant, and everything. Margaret, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>dear, take Mr. Harcourt into the office and settle this
matter with him. By the time you get through your
father and the boys will be in for their dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Mr. Harcourt, and see papa’s little office.
It used to be called ‘the study,’ but papa never ‘studies,’
he only keeps his farm books there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt followed her out of doors to a little brick
building of one room, standing on the lawn in the rear
of the irregular house. She opened the door and admitted
him. It was a rude place, heated by an iron
stove, and furnished with a writing-desk, a book shelf,
a table, an armchair and two or three other chairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Harcourt,” she inquired, when they were seated,
“did you know this Mr. Amos Merritt, of Washington?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very slightly,” answered the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The reason why I asked was this—he seems to be
so anxious to find you. In every letter he has written,
enclosing checks, he has inquired if we had heard
from you. And I must also add that we, too, often
returned the question, and asked if he had received
news of the missing man; for you were a missing man
for months, Mr. Harcourt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it; but my dear Miss Wynthrop, I cannot
just now fully explain my absence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not ask you to do so. Your mother thought
that you were at college. She pined to see you, especially
at Christmas; but she thought that you remained
at college to pursue your studies through the
holidays.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you knew better?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course we did; for I wrote to President Ewell
to inquire for you, and learned that you had not been
there since last summer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you did not tell my mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! We could not. We said nothing, but left
her to that delusion, as to others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you for that kind consideration. Ah! I
have so much to thank you for, Miss Wynthrop!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You make me wish there was no such word as
‘thankful.’ I told you this morning that we only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>pleased ourselves in trying to make Mrs. Harcourt
happy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are angels!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fiddle-de-dee!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, if there be anything that takes a poor fellow
down it is “fiddle-de-dee!” Harcourt collapsed. Margaret
Wynthrop laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a rude farm office, where accounts are audited,
and not a place for sentiment, Mr. Harcourt. I
brought you here for the settlement of business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am at your orders, Miss Wynthrop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First of all, I would ask you if I am liberty to write
to Mr. Amos Merritt and end his suspense and anxiety
on your account?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most certainly. I have not been in hiding, though
I may not now explain the cause of my disappearance.
Write, and set the worthy counselor at ease; also set
at ease the party behind him, and for whom he acts,
for my acquaintance with Mr. Merritt would scarcely
account for his personal interest in my affairs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suspected that there was some friend in the background,”
Margaret Wynthrop candidly confessed.
“But I cannot conjecture who it may be. Can you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I cannot with any reasonable degree of probability,”
Harcourt replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I have a check, received this morning, to
acknowledge. I will ‘take this opportunity,’ as our
grandparents used to write in the beginning of their
letters, to let Mr. Merritt and ‘the power behind the
throne’ know that you are here. And now,” continued
the girl, turning to the writing-desk, unlocking the
drawer, and taking from it a sealed envelope, “here are
all the receipts for money expended for the benefit of
Mrs. Harcourt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg that you will keep them. I do not wish to
see them,” pleaded the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why not? You will hereafter transact your
mother’s business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Harcourt, “I cannot. I must go away
again in a very few days. Pray, Miss Wynthrop, continue
your work of Christian love. Be still the trustee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and guardian of this poor lady, for a time at least. It
may not be long,” pleaded Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why should you think it necessary to be so very
emphatic? I shall take pleasure in caring for Mrs.
Harcourt just so long as she has need and I have
power.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! thank you! And continue to expend those
checks and the checks that I will send you also, for
her necessities, including the cost of her board and
lodging, fixing the latter according to your own judgment
and pleasure. Oh! I loathe to speak to you of
money matters!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why should you dislike to do so? It is necessary.
I will do as you wish, and give the result of
my figuring before you leave us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Margaret Wynthrop drew a small silver watch from
her pocket and consulted it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is our dinner hour, and mamma will be waiting.
We had better return to the house now,” she said, as
she replaced her timepiece. Then she locked the desk
and left the room, followed by Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they came toward the rear of the house they saw
Martha leave the kitchen, which was a separate building,
and enter the back door of Mrs. Harcourt’s room,
bearing a well laden dinner tray in her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does my mother always take her meals alone?”
Harcourt inquired, as they entered the rear door of
the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, always; not only from necessity, but from
choice. She is too feeble to sit up at the table, and
too disinclined to motion to walk to the dining-room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Margaret spoke the front door opposite to them
opened, and Mr. Wynthrop and his eldest son, Silas,
entered the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Wynthrop was a tall, gaunt, dark man, with
black hair, cut rather short, and black goatee, both
well streaked with silver.</p>

<p class='c009'>His son was also tall and thin, but fair, like his
mother and sisters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both men were clothed in rough, serviceable suits
of brown cheviot.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>On seeing Margaret, and recognizing the visitor who
was with her as Harcourt, both men came up with outstretched
hands and hearty words of welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad to see you,” spoke both in a breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When did you arrive?” inquired the elder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the Lodge here only this morning,” answered
Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dinner ready, Margaret?” inquired the younger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose so, Si. I have just come from the
office.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she spoke the door of the sitting-room opened,
and Mrs. Wynthrop, who had heard the talk, came
out with her daughter Elizabeth, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dinner is ready; we are only waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They entered the dining-room, which was just in
the rear of the sitting-room, and gathered around the
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Wynthrop, a churchman of the old Puritanical
type, asked a blessing on the feast in a rather long
prayer, but when that was over he fell to, helping
his guest, his family and himself with more liberality
than discretion, and then gave himself up to the enjoyment
of creature comforts with more than ordinary
zeal.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the meal was not prolonged. Twenty minutes
finished it for everybody.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they left the table Martha came up and said
to Harcourt:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Young marse, de ole madam is axin’ fo’ yo’ ag’in.
She seems moughty queer, she do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt immediately followed the woman to his
mother’s room.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was sitting in the same chair, knitting, as before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down, Will, my dear. Your father has just
gone out. He says that I must cheer up, for I shall
soon be well—well enough to leave this room; and
Will, he says that he has got a beautiful new home
for me, where I shall be sure to grow strong and
hearty, and renew my youth. Just think of that,
Will!” said the poor lady, with her face beaming.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“I am glad to hear that, mother. Did he tell you
where it was?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, no. I asked him, but he only said it was
not far off; it was nearer than I thought; but he said
he couldn’t tell me any more about it because he
wanted to give me a happy surprise. And—well, I
really think he has been building a beautiful house
while I have been here. I know I shall get perfectly
well again, because your father says so, and I have
such faith in his judgment. Where are the young
ladies?” she next inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They have gone into the drawing-room, mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, dear, go and make yourself agreeable
to them. I shall take a nap. I always do after dinner.
You can come to me again when I wake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me stay until you fall asleep, mother. I will
not disturb you. Will you lie down?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear; just lean back and close my eyes. I
sleep best in my chair in the daytime,” she answered,
as she composed herself for her nap.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt watched her until she fell asleep. He
was anxious to observe her in that state. He saw
that she slept calmly, and breathed easily; and then
he stole out of the room, found Martha, sent her to
stay with her mistress, and then joined the ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Wynthrop would not hear of Harcourt leaving
the lodge to take up his abode at the cabin, but insisted
that he should occupy a spare room just over
the parlor chamber tenanted by his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the day of his arrival at Lone Lodge poor Will
Harcourt began to improve in health. Two of the
heaviest burdens on his heart were lifted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma had escaped unharmed from Hanson. His
mother was happy, comfortable and well cared for.
She would never know the black cloud that overshadowed
his own future. Those two beloved ones, to
save whom from shame and despair he had been
driven to do that “deed without a name,” were, at
least, safe from injury.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for himself, he knew that he had never intended
to commit a crime; that so far as he was concerned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the death of Yelverton was, indeed, a mere accident,
yet none the less did it weigh so heavily on his conscience
that he felt the only relief for him would be
to give himself up to justice and let the law have its
will of him. And this he would do so soon as he
could do it without wounding others, when his mother
would be safe in her heavenly home, when Roma
would learn the whole bitter truth and understand
and forgive him; then he could face the consequences
of his crime and bear the doom of death or the penal
servitude that the law would deal out to him, better,
much better, than he had borne the weight of a guilty
conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, having settled his plans for the future, and living
now for a few days in such an atmosphere of
peace, love and light, his health improved and his
spirits rose—yes, even against his will and his conscience,
his spirits rose—and he was strangely comforted.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mother noticed his improvement, and expressed
her delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See what rest and recreation have done for you,
dear Will,” she said, smiling on him as he sat one
morning by her chair. “You must not think of going
back to college until after the summer vacation is
over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear mother, I would gladly stay if I might, but
I must leave you in a few days. I will, however, come
often to see you,” he said, with a responsive smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! what a devoted student you are!” she exclaimed,
patting his head. “The one genius of our
family. We shall all be very proud of you some day,
Will, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he thought of his blighted ambition, and his
penal future, he could only smile at her words, as one
might smile at stake and faggot.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he was pleased that she took his proposed departure
so pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The early spring days passed cheerfully. Mr. Wynthrop
and Mr. Silas often drew Harcourt out to go
with them to the fields, and often, seeing those two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>men work with the hired laborers, he would join with
them, and take hold heartily of any work that might
be going on. The evenings in the parlor, with the
kind-hearted, gay-spirited women of the family, were
very pleasant, also, though he only joined them when
his mother was asleep, or when she bade him go and
entertain their “visitors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was never lonesome, for she never seemed to
be alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost every time he went in to see her she had
something to tell him about his father, or John, or
Peyton, or Caroline, or Ann Eliza, who, one or another,
or all, had just been in to see her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt had grown so accustomed to these “delusions”
that he was no longer shocked by them, but
was reconciled to what made the poor lady happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Martha, on the contrary, though she had so long
borne them, could never get used to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To lib wid ghoses!” she would complain to Harcourt,
“to hab ’em all youn’ yo’ day an’ night, to
year de ole madam talkin’ an’ laughin’ ’long ob ’em!
An’ nebber to see ’em, nor year ’em, but Lor’, I doane
wan’ ter do dat! no, sah! But den, not to know how
close dey may come to yo’! Oh, Lor’! It’s wusn de
feber’n ager! I gets dashes ob ice water an’ flames ob
fire ober me—one arter de oder! Ugh! An’ I darsn’t
tel de ole madam dey is ghoses, an’ nuffin but ghoses,
’caze she fink dey’s yale, an’ Missus Wyn’op say it
might kill her to tell her dat. Ugh! Wot I hab come
to in de wenable ole ages ob my pilg’imidge!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bear your burden, Martha, and you will meet your
reward,” said the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I has beared my burden—cheerful! an’ I does bear
my burdens—patient! But it ain’t burdens as is turnin’
ob my ha’r w’ite—burdens is nat’rel. It’s ghoses—ghoses
wot yo’ can’t see—fank Him fo’ dat much!—nor
take hol’ ob, nor turn out, nor likewise do nuffin
wid!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, they wouldn’t hurt you if they could, and
they couldn’t hurt you if they would. Besides, you
will be a ghost yourself some day.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Oh, Lor’, young marse, yo’s bad as dem. Dere! I
gwine away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Many such talks as these took place between the
young man and the old servant.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last the day came when Harcourt felt that he
must leave the pleasant country house, now that it
was looking so beautiful in the early April weather,
with grass and foliage, all of that tender emerald
green only seen in the young spring, with the fruit
trees all in blossom, with the hyacinths and daffodils,
the tulips and jonquils, all budding in the flower bed;
with the lovely crocuses and violets blooming all
over the lawn—he must leave all that, and the genial
family, and the dear mother, and the comforts of
home, and go back to self-imposed servitude. True,
Harcourt might have got more congenial employment
as a teacher, but he told himself that he was unworthy
to become an instructor of youth, and that
nothing remained for him but manual labor.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took leave of all his kind friends, who parted
from him with real regret.</p>

<p class='c009'>He bade a tender good-by to his old mother, who
let him go very cheerfully, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your father and John say that you ought to go,
and must go, and that I must not mind, as they will
be with me. So I do not mean to hinder you, my
boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Harcourt sadly, “it is true. I ought to
go, and I must go. Good-by, dear mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God bless you, my good boy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they parted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt had intended to walk to Logwood, but
when he stepped out upon the piazza he saw the pony
carriage before the house, and Margaret Wynthrop,
in a coat and hat, on the seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have to go to do some shopping in Goeberlin, so,
if you please, I will drive you there,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you very much. But suppose you let me
take the reins; would not that be more fitting?” he
inquired as he stepped into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“As you please. But I am used to driving,” she
said as she surrendered the “ribbons.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That drive up and down hill, through the tender,
budding April woods, remained a pleasant episode of
life in the memory of Will Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they reached Logwood there was a full hour
to spare before the train was due.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said Margaret, “will you go around with
me on my shopping expedition, or shall you go directly
to the depot?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the depot, if you please,” said Harcourt, for
he thought that his company might really be an embarrassment
to the young woman on such an occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>They drove to the little wayside group of sheds
that did duty as a depot, and Harcourt got out,
thanked the young lady for the lift, took leave of her,
and went into the station to buy his ticket and wait
for the train.</p>

<p class='c009'>It promised to be a weary waiting, so he went out
and walked up and down the platform for exercise.
He had not passed more than twenty minutes in this
manner when suddenly he saw Margaret Wythrop
driving back toward the station and waving a letter
in her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>He hastened to meet her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is for you,” she said. “I have just taken it out
of the post office. Good-by! good-by!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She handed the letter, turned the pony’s head, and
drove off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt glanced at the superscription, reeled, and
nearly fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>A railway porter caught and steadied him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter with you, young man? Have
you been drinking? No, your breath don’t smell so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The porter, holding his arm, guided his steps into
the waiting-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt submitted like an automaton.</p>

<p class='c009'>The porter let him down on a chair and left him.
Harcourt stared at the letter that he held fast
clutched in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>It was from Roma!</p>

<p class='c009'>He had recognized her handwriting at a glance, and
was overwhelmed by the sight of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now he stared at it in a conflict of emotion—joy,
shame, fear—that he should hear from her again, that
she should write to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he scarcely dared to open the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>What should he find there? Oh, what scorn and
hatred—what reproaches and maledictions should he
meet? And all so well deserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length, with a desperate resolution, as one who
had been compelled to go into fire would take the
plunge, he tore open the letter, and read:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will, my own dear Will, I have only just this instant
learned where you are staying. Come to me at
once, my beloved. We cannot reach a mutual understanding
by letters. I am just starting for Goblin
Hall. Meet me there. Your own</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Roma</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was well the waiting-room was empty, that no
one might witness the utter breakdown of the young
man. He dropped his head upon his hands and burst
into a storm of sobs and tears—the first tears that he
had shed in the tragedy of his youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It needed but these words,” he wailed, in low
tones. “It needed but these words to complete despair.
Coals of fire! Coals of fire! Coals of fire!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='c007'>ROMA’S DELUSIVE JOY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When gray-haired Amos Merritt burst in upon
Roma Fronde on that early April day, and, with almost
boyish exultation, exclaimed, “I have good news
for you! Will Harcourt is found!” great throbs of
joy pulsated through her frame, almost depriving her
of the power of speech. She who had borne the heaviest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>shocks of fate without losing her self-command,
was almost overcome by this sudden joy. She started
to her feet, and uttered but one syllable:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At Lone Lodge, with Mrs. Harcourt,” replied the
lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?” she panted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In good health. Both mother and son are at present
the guests of the Wynthrops. I had a letter to-day
from Miss Margaret. She writes that they——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop!” exclaimed Roma, recovering her self-possession
with great effort. “I must write immediately
to catch the mail. I will hear details later.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And she hastened to her desk and wrote the letter
which we have already seen, asking Will Harcourt to
meet her as soon as possible at Goblin Hall, for which
she was about to start.</p>

<p class='c009'>She closed and directed the letter, and was about
to leave the room to put it in the house box for the
mail messenger, when Mr. Merritt arrested her steps
by saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give it to me. I am going directly back to my
chambers, and I will post it on the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you; but I thought you were going to tell
me all about the Harcourts?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I was; but, on second thoughts, I will leave
Miss Wynthrop’s letter with you. Here it is. You
see, I really ought to be at my office. It is now ten
minutes after ten, and I have to meet a client at
eleven. Are you still resolved to leave the city to-morrow
morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes. I have written to Will Harcourt to meet
me at Goblin Hall immediately. That means as soon
as steam can take him there, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I shall return to spend the last evening with
you. Good-morning, my child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, good friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little Owlet, who had been sitting demurely on a
hassock, nursing a black bull pup Tom had given her,
now looked up and asked:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“What is it all about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A dear, very dear friend, whom I have not seen
for months,” replied Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I thought, from what the lawyer said; but he
did say, too, that somebody had been found. Now,
nobody could be found unless they had been lost,
could they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was it your friend who was lost?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And his name was Will something or other. I
remember that much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will Harcourt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! That was it! Who lost him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He himself, I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was he a very little boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear; he is a man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, if he is a man, he is not possessed of common
sense, to go and lose himself. Who found him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, dear. I wish to read this letter,
which will tell me, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, read it, and I will go and take George
Thomas out for a walk on the pavement,” said the
child; and she arose and carried the puppy, on whom
she had bestowed the double name, out of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma read Margaret Wynthrop’s letter, giving the
account of Harcourt’s sudden arrival at Lone Lodge,
and of his distress at finding the mind of his aged
mother failing, even though that failure was attended
by a happy hallucination. From the tone of the
letter Roma judged that Harcourt had never mentioned
his defeated marriage, and that the Wynthrops
were ignorant of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>This circumstance seemed very strange to Roma,
and if it did not deepen the mystery of that unparalleled
marriage ceremony, it certainly threw no light
upon its darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she would soon see Harcourt, and learn the
truth from him, she said to herself, as she laid aside
Miss Wynthrop’s letter and set about completing her
last preparations for her journey.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>In the midst of packing her traveling bag she was
interrupted by the entrance of Owlet with her puppy
in her arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you were going to read your letter? If I
had known you were going to work I would have
stayed to help you” said Owlet solemnly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have finished my letter, dear, and now I am only
putting up a few things in my bag for use during our
journey,” Roma explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, let me help you. You sit down in your
big easy-chair, and I will put George Thomas to bed
in his basket. He is very sleepy. And I will bring
you all the things you want to pack in the bag,” Owlet
insisted. And she laid her pet in his nest, and came
and stood before her benefactress in an attitude of
attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I have quite finished now, dear, and there is
nothing more to do,” Roma explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if I can’t be useful I might as well be dead,”
said Owlet with an aggrieved air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear child! Why should you say such things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard Mrs. Brown talking to somebody, and she
said people who are of no use in the world had better
be out of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that was a hard saying; besides, do you not
think that the Lord knows when it is best to take
any one out of the world?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve got me there,” said Owlet. “I give in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And anybody who would not give in when they are
wrong is not possessed of common sense,” concluded
Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>At eight o’clock Mr. Merritt came to spend his last
evening with Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet was allowed to sit up with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder what you will do with this child?” inquired
the lawyer in an aside to Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall do with her, if I should be permitted to keep
her, just what I should do with a little orphan sister,
if I were blessed with one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now, Roma, my child, I did not come here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>to loaf. What can I do for you in the way of preparation
for to-morrow? Any trunk to cord up, or to sit
down on, or to be dispatched to the express office? In
short, anything to be done that I can do for you?”
inquired Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, nothing, thank you. Our baggage has all been
sent off, and you have nothing to do except to sit here
and give us your company, so long as you can spare
the time,” Roma replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” added Owlet, striking into the conversation,
“you need not think we only like to see you for what
you can do for us. We like to see you because we
like you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, ma’am; that is very complimentary,”
laughed the old lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I meant it to be,” said Owlet solemnly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Roma, my dear,” said Mr. Merritt, as he rose
to bid them good-night, “instead of meeting you at
the depot at nine o’clock to-morrow morning, as I
had first intended to do, I shall call here with a carriage
at half-past eight to take you and the child
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear friend, do not put yourself to that trouble,”
Roma objected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my child, it will give me half an hour more
to spend in your company, and that will be a great
boon to a poor old fellow who is about to lose you,
for heaven knows how many months,” sighed the old
lawyer, lugubriously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You take a holiday every summer, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Last summer contained the first holiday I have had
since my college days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you will certainly take a holiday this summer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, and every summer henceforth, so long as
I live, please the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then come and spend this next one with us among
the wooded hills of Maryland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I? Thank you! I certainly will do so, with
pleasure, if I am spared. Good-night, my dear. Good-night,
little Owl!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>So, after shaking hands with Roma, and kissing Owlet,
the lawyer left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after this Roma rang her bell, and when it
was answered by Tom she gave him a parting “remembrance”
for himself and one for his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom grinned with delight, and then suddenly “boo-hooed”
at the thought that his friends were going
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t cry. I dare say you and auntie can come
and spend your summer holiday with us, too,” said
Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, Tom,” added Roma, “if ever you or your
mother would like to change city work for country
work, come to me, and you shall have employment.
Stay, I will give you my address, so that you can write
or get a letter written whenever you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She took a card, wrote her full address, and gave
it to the boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom stopped howling as he pocketed it, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, ma’am. Mammy like to go back to de
country, mammy do, as the city ain’t wot it’s cracked
up to be, nohow, mammy say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose your mother has gone to bed now, but
tell her she can come and take leave of me any time
to-morrow between seven and half-past eight o’clock.
Now, good-night, Tom. God bless you,” said Roma
very gently as she dismissed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, ma’am—and—little Miss—oh, boo-hoo-woo!”
howled the boy as he ran out of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my little Owlet, we must go to bed if we
wish to get up early in the morning,” Roma explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>And in twenty minutes more the lady and the child
had retired; but only Owlet went to sleep. Roma
was kept wide awake with thoughts of the coming
interview and explanation between herself and Harcourt.
It was near morning when she first fell into
a fitful sleep, from which she was soon fully aroused
by the restlessness of Owlet, who had got up and
dressed herself, and was fidgeting about the room in
a manner wholly inconsistent with her usually still
and staid demeanor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Oh, you are awake!” she said when she heard Roma
stir and saw her eyes open. “It is after seven o’clock,
and you told Tom’s mother that she might come any
time between seven and half-past eight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You extremely literal Owlet, has the woman been
up to see me?” inquired Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, ma’am, she hasn’t; but I hear her coming now,”
Owlet said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma also heard the cheery voice of the cook as
she came along the hall, talking to some one in her
company, who did not answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma stepped out of bed, drew on her dressing-gown,
thrust her feet into slippers, and sat down in
her armchair to receive the visitors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet opened the door before they had time to rap,
and admitted Tom and his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gwine away dis mornin’, young mist’ess? I’s orful
sorry to year it, an’ I’se orful busy, long o’ de breakfas’,
too, dough dere ain’t mo’ dan one-quarter ob de
people in de house as dere was in de winter, neider.
Still, breakfas’ is breakfas’, an’ it has fo’ to be got,”
said Lucy, with a succession of old country courtesies,
as she stood respectfully before the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry to part with you, too,” Roma replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ young mist’ess, I do fank yo’ so much fo’ dat
same gif’ yo’ gib me. I ain’t had no sich a gif’ sence
ebber I lef’ de ole Snake in ye ole times ’fo’ de wo’, I
ain’t, fo’ de trufe; an’ I fank yo’, young mist’ess, fo’
dat same fibe-dollar gol’ piece.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very welcome; but the ‘Snake,’ did you
say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“De ole Sarpint—yes, mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What old Serpent?” inquired Roma, for though she
knew very well what Lucy meant, having heard from
Tom that he and his “mammy” had come from the
Isle of Storms, yet she wished to draw the woman out,
to make an opening by which she might naturally disclose
her own connection with that place, which she
had not wished to do until now, when she was about
to leave Washington.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“De islan’, young mist’ess, w’ere de fambly ob de
Guyon libbed ebber sence de ole times ’fo’ de wo.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you live with the Guyons?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’, yes, young mist’ess; I ’longed to dem. Did
yo’ know ’em, young mist’ess?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very slightly, I regret to say, though my dear
mother, who died when I was a babe, was Romaine
Guyon, the sister of Henry Guyon, who died three
years ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lucy’s eyes opened to their widest extent, and for
a moment she seemed deprived of the power of speech,
and then she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now de Lor’ hab mercy on my po’ ole soul! Young
mist’ess, yo’ ain’t nebber de darter ob Miss Yomaine,
wot married dat young man f’om de Wes’, named
F’onde?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I am her daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Lor’, I might ’a’ knowed it by de likeness,
well as de manners—so I might. To fink ob meetin’
ob yo’ yere, in dis bressed house, in dis furrin city
ob Washington! Well, wunners will nebber cease!
An’ jes’ as I hab foun’ yo’ out yo’s gwine to leabe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And here Lucy put her apron up to her eyes and
sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, I did not tell you this to distress you,
but to open a way for better days to come. I know
that many of you elderly colored people who came
to the city to live and find work are disappointed,
either in work or wages, or in the ability of adapting
yourselves to the new circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot dat yo’ say, young mist’ess? Please say it
ober ag’in. I doane quite take it all in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I meant that some of you come to the city and
don’t find what you want, and would rather go back
to the country, if you could.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat’s so! Lor’, ’tain’t ’cause people ain’t good to
me, ’cause dey is. But—no—’tain’t ’cause dey doane
gib good wages, ’cause dey does; but, honey, it’s f’eedom
one way, an’ not f’eedom ’nudder way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean by that, Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dis a way, honey; I yearns my own libin’, an’ has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>my own money, an’ w’en my work is done I kin go
an’ comt putty much as I p’ease; but, Lor’, honey, dere
ain’t no place to go an’ come to but streets an’ streets,
an’ houses an’ houses; an’ I sort ob miss de fiel’s an’
de woods an’ de country all t’rough. Dat’s wot’s de
matter ’long ob me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought so. Well, at any time you please you
may come to me at Goblin Hall, and I will give you
employment about the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, fanky, honey! An’ Tom, too?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Tom, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, oh, Lor’! I’s got to yun down an’ ten’ to
breakfas’. Sary Ann is down dere, for true, but she
ain’t wuff much. Wot shill I sen’ yo’ up, young mist’ess,
or would yo’ yudder come down to de yestyant,
now dere ain’t hardly anybody dere, ’specially at dis
airly hour ob de mornin’? Airly fo’ de city, min’ yo’,
young mist’ess. ’Twould be ’sidered moughty late fo’
de country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will go down, Lucy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den I will try to see yo’ ag’in, if it’s only frough
de do’. Fank de Lor’ as de kitchen is jus’ ’hind de
yestyant!” said the cook, as with a half suppressed
sob she left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, Tom!” exclaimed Roma, as the boy was about
to follow. “Take all these things down to the hall.
I shall not return to this room after leaving it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And she gave her traveling bag, umbrella and
shawls to the boy, who, with a half smothered howl,
took them and went out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Roma hastened to dress herself for her journey,
and when she had done so she collected all her
remaining effects, put them in a second bag, and then
took a long, last look around the rooms she had occupied
for four months, and might never see again. She
opened the west window and looked out upon the bit
of woods which the march of improvement had still
spared behind this newly opened street in the northwestern
suburb of “the city of magnificent distances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She hoped that it would yet be spared, and inclosed
in a park, rather than be swept away.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Then she invoked a blessing on the house and on
all who might come into it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma, in some moods of her mind, was devout almost
to the verge of fanaticism, and had been more
than once accused of superstition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, darling, we will go down now,” she said,
and took her little Owlet by the hand and led her
out, the child carrying the dog basket in which the
pup was to travel.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the elevator she remembered the lad who ran
the machine, and gave him a gift.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You asked everybody else to come to see us in the
country, why don’t you ask poor Titus? He is an
orphan boy, too,” said Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I will,” said Roma. Then, turning to the lad,
who could not have been more than ten years old,
though he did run the elevator, she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Titus, what is your full name, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Titus Blair, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you lodge here, or only come by the day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I lodge here, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Titus, if you should ever have a holiday, and
would like to enjoy it in the country, you just tell
Mr. Merritt—you know him, and you know where he
lives—and he will send you to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am. Thank you, ma’am. That would be
too good!” exclaimed the lad, breaking into a broad
grin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we are on the landing. Good-by, now, Titus,”
said Roma, shaking hands with him as they left the
elevator.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by, Titus. Mind, when your holidays come,
you are to ask Lawyer Merritt to send you down to
Goblin Hall. He’ll do anything for our lady here. I
reckon he will marry her some day, and maybe I’ll
marry you, Titus, when we grow up,” said Owlet,
as she took Roma’s hand and passed into the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma sometimes felt a little shocked at the child’s
freedom, and even rudeness, of speech, but she could
not yet find it in her heart to rebuke the newly bereaved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>orphan. She would defer all training until
they should reach Goblin Hall, when she would begin
it in the spirit of love.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there any one else you would like to invite to
Goblin Hall, ma’am?” she inquired, with sly humor,
as she led Owlet into the dining-room and they sat
down at one of the tables.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not,” replied the child, looking at the
questioner in grave wonder. “There are Mr. Merritt,
Lucy, Tom and Titus. They are enough. We can’t
have all the world at Goblin Hall! ‘There is reason
in roasting eggs.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I stand corrected,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is Mr. Merritt now!” exclaimed Owlet, as
the lawyer came in, and, without any ceremony, took
a seat at the same table with them, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, my dear. Good-morning, Miss Catherine.
I have come to breakfast with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are very glad to see you, I am sure. Are we
not, Owlet?” Roma said, shaking hands with her old
friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He knows we are. It’s no use telling him,” the
child added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fact is, Roma, I had no appetite at the early hour
at which I ordered the carriage, but thought I should
get one by the time I had driven from one end of the
city to the other, and I have. Ah! here’s Tom! What
have you to serve up to us in the way of new luxuries?
Fresh shad, by the powers! And fine strawberries!
I am glad I came.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no one else in the dining-room at this
early hour but our party, so not only could Tom give
them his undivided attention, but Lucy came in on
every excusable occasion for the sake of seeing and
speaking with her own young mistress as often as
possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>When breakfast was over the lady and child once
more took leave of their colored friends and went out,
attended by the lawyer, who placed them in the carriage,
where they found their effects placed by the
careful hands of Tom.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Half an hour’s drive brought them to the Baltimore
&#38; Ohio Railway depot, where they found the
train for the west almost ready to start.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merritt saw Roma and Owlet comfortably seated
in a drawing-room car, and there took an affectionate
leave of them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='c007'>AT GOBLIN HALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Little Owlet, though a young child, was an old
traveler. Before she met her benefactress the days
of her life that had not been spent in hotels and theaters
had been passed in steamboats and railway trains.
So to her there was none of the novelty that so much
delights children. Yet she could not but enjoy the
rapid motion through a beautiful country just bursting
into leaf and blossom all over the land.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merritt’s friendly care had supplied Roma with
all the new magazines, and for Owlet a basket of fruit
and confectionery.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Roma refrained from cutting the attractive
pages, and gave herself up to the entertainment of
her little traveling companion, and she was, in her
turn, amused with the quaint remarks of the little
owl.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day passed without incidents other than the
usual events of railway travel. This was an express
train, and stopped only at the most important stations.</p>

<p class='c009'>At two o’clock in the afternoon they had luncheon
brought in from the restaurant car, and served on
a little side table laid between Roma and Owlet’s
seat. Even this manner of meal, so new and delightful
to most children, had no charm of novelty for this
little theatrical waif. She ate and drank with the
solemnity of “an old stager,” and afterward took
George Thomas from his basket and fed him. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>she settled herself back in her big chair to take an
after-dinner nap, like the proverbial and plethoric alderman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma cut the pages of a magazine, and read.</p>

<p class='c009'>The child slept on, lulled by the motion of the cars,
until the sun set, when she opened her eyes to find
her benefactress absorbed in the pages of her magazine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you know you ought not to read when the
train is in motion?” she gravely demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not, ma’am?” inquired Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If anybody but you had asked such a question I
should think they were not possessed of common
sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you have not answered my question, and really
I would like to be informed why I ought not to read
when the cars are in motion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, because it will ruin your eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but how do you know that, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because mamma always said so, and eyes were
business with her. She had to take care of her eyes
and keep them beautiful, to please people who came
to see her dance in pantomime.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand, and am convinced.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, mamma would never read in the cars, or by
gaslight, or even when she was lying down; she was
so careful of her eyes. She used to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the child’s voice, that had been quivering, suddenly
broke down, and she sank on the floor, hid her
face in the cushions of the chair, and broke into sobs
and tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma gently lifted and gathered little Owlet to her
bosom, bent tenderly over her, but spoke no word, for
she felt it was best not to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Owlet’s paroxysm of emotion exhausted
itself, and she got off Roma’s lap, went back to her
chair, wiped her eyes, and said, penitently:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anybody might think I was not possessed of common
sense, to behave so before the whole carload of
people, and set them all to staring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The men and women, and even the children among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>their fellow passengers, had been looking at the tempestuous
passion of grief in the little girl, but when
they saw her black dress trimmed with crape they
looked in compassion, not in curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma really did not know what to say to this unique
child, but only gazed on her with eyes full of love and
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun went down behind the line of mountains
toward which they were being rapidly whirled.</p>

<p class='c009'>The porter came into the car to light the lamps,
and the illumination within prevented them from seeing
the beauty and brilliancy of the starlight night
around them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They crossed a spur of the Alleghany Mountains
without getting a view of their grandeur, and rushed
westward into the high-hilled and deep-valed and
heavily wooded country in which Goblin Hall is situated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet went to sleep again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of their fellow passengers dozed in their
chairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the sleeping car ahead of them people were going
to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma felt too anxious to think of sleeping. The
nearer she approached the house where she was to
meet Will Harcourt, and hear his vindication—for
she was sure that his statement would be a perfect
vindication of himself—the more restless and impatient
she became. She had only written her letter to
him on the day before her journey. She knew that he
could scarcely yet have received it, and that if he
should start for Goblin Hall immediately on the receipt
of her summons it must be from twelve to eighteen
hours yet before he could arrive there. Yet, still,
she was impatient to get to the end of her journey, as
if she expected to meet him then and there.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was nine o’clock when they reached Pine Hill
Junction, where they left the main line for the little
train that passed Goeberlin in its course.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet woke up to change cars, but went to sleep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>again as soon as they were settled in their new seats,
and slept until they reached Goeberlin, at ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>There she woke up, bright and alert, and seized the
dog basket, with her precious bull pup.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very dark at the little station, only one light
showing itself from the front of the small ticket office
and waiting-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pompous Pirate” was there with the old family
carriage, and “Puck” with a farm wagon.</p>

<p class='c009'>He left his steady horses and came up to the train
as it stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All well, Pompous?” inquired Roma, as she handed
Owlet down to the astonished negro, and then stepped
to the platform.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perfec’ly well, mist’ess. Who’ chile dis yere?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A little friend of mine. Here, take these checks,
and get our baggage,” said Roma, who had loaded
herself with two bags, an umbrella and a shawl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dere, gimme dem fings, too, an’ yo’ go inter de
station, mist’ess. I’ll ’ten’ to all dese.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma gave up her burdens, including Owlet’s dog
basket, and led Owlet up and down the platform to
benefit by the balmy evening air.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train moved off on its westward journey and
left them there.</p>

<p class='c009'>So prompt was Pompous that in less than fifteen
minutes he came up and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“All yeady to go now, mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma followed him to the end of the platform at
which the carriage stood—because it could come no
nearer—and entered it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous lifted the child in, shut the door, mounted
to his seat on the box, and started his horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Puck followed with all their baggage, in the wagon,
and so they drove on under the starlit sky, along the
five-mile road, up and down the heavily wooded hills
and dales that lay between Goeberlin and Goblin Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma looked out as they approached the house, but
she could only see the dim outline of the roof and
walls and three or four bright lights gleaming through
the windows, upstairs and down.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>When the carriage stopped before the front the
door was opened, showing the interior of the lighted
hall and the tall, solemn figure of “Serious,” standing
on the threshold.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet was now so sound asleep that she had to be
lifted from the carriage and carried into the house,
in the arms of Pompous.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not wake the child, if you can possibly help
it. Lay her on the broad lounge in the parlor,” said
Roma as she stepped from the carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do, Ceres?” she cheerfully inquired of
the kill-joy who stood there to receive her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fanky, miss, I do as well as I kin in sich a mis’able
worl’ as dis. An’ how do yo’ do yo’se’f? An’ so yo’s
got home sabe, w’ich is mo’ dan I looked fo’. An’ did
Mis’er and Missis Gray an’ de chillun get drowned at
sea, goin’ to furrin countries?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no. They arrived safe, and were all quite well
when I heard from them, a week ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, dat’s mo’ dan I ’spected, too,” said Serious,
in the tone of saying, “And more than they deserved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, come in, young mist’ess, or yo’ll be gettin’
ob yo’ deaf ob col’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! On this fine April night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ap’il weader is ’ceitful, young mist’ess—moughty
’ceitful,” said the sorrowful philosopher, as she opened
the door of the oak parlor, where a pleasant fire was
burning and a neat supper table was set.</p>

<p class='c009'>An armchair was placed near the hearth. A broad
lounge stood against the wall, and on it lay Owlet,
fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous had left the room to help Puck to bring
in the baggage and to stable the horses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think I want supper, Ceres,” said Roma,
as she drew off her gloves, took off her bonnet, and
sank down into the armchair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ now who de name ob de Lor’ is dis chile?”
demanded Serious, for the first time noticing Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A little girl whom I’m going to take care of for a
while,” answered Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“Whose chile is she, den, shove off on to yo’ mist’ess?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is an orphan.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lor’! I hope yo’ ain’t gwine to ’dop’ her, young
mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless her grandmother, who is a wealthy English
woman, should claim her, I certainly shall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lor’ young mist’ess! Yo’ doane know wot yo’s
a-doin’ ob! Raisin’ udder people’s chillun! Oh, Lor’!
She gwine be a heap o’ trouble, ’deed she is. Heap
o’ trouble. She gwine to hab de measles, an’ de scarlet
feber, an’ de whoopin’ cough, an’—an’—an’—all
dem dere. Oh, young mist’ess, sen’ her to de ’sylum.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must put her to bed. Is there a fire in my bedroom?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sartin, ma’am. But yo’ gwine to put dat chile inter
yo’ own bedroom?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and into my bed. She has slept with me
ever since her poor mother died. Now take a candle
and light me upstairs,” said Roma, as she tenderly
lifted the child from the lounge and carried her out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Serious, moaning and groaning, and predicting all
sorts of calamities from the presence of the unconscious
child, went up before her mistress and opened
the bedroom door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma laid the child on the outside of the bed and
began to undress her so softly and deftly that Owlet
never fully waked up, but only sighed with relief at
being able to stretch out her tired limbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Open that bag on the floor and give me the little
nightdress out of it,” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>Serious groaned, and obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Roma, having gently slipped the dainty white
cambric gown on the small sleeper, turned down the
bed and tenderly laid the little one within it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she dismissed Serious for the night, and disrobed,
and retired to rest, and—thanks to the day’s
fatiguing journey—she also, notwithstanding her anxiety,
sank to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! oh! oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>These words were the first sounds heard by Roma
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>when she awoke on the morning after her arrival at
Goblin Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked up, and saw little Owlet standing, in her
white nightgown, at the front window, which, with
her usual innocent assurance, she had taken the
liberty to open.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, little one, up so early?” said Roma cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, look! look! look! Did you ever? Did you
ever? Did you ever?” exclaimed Owlet, in a rapture
of delight, not once turning her eyes from the something
that entranced her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Surprised at this outburst of wild enthusiasm from
the usually grave and non-admiring child, Roma
stepped out of bed and went to the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>She saw nothing unusual there, only the sunlit
heavens and earth, the deep blue sky, with a few soft
white clouds, the green, wooded hills and vales, and,
nearer the house, gently sloping uplands covered with
orchards of apple, peach and cherry trees in full blossom,
making a forest of pink and white and red bloom;
and just under the window the newly set flower beds,
with the early spring crocuses, pansies, violets, tulips,
jonquils, daffodils and hyacinths, just breaking into
bloom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet Roma understood that to the city child all this
must seem enchanting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s like heaven! Isn’t it like heaven? Isn’t
it the Garden of Eden, where Adam and Eve used to
live? Oh! I could just jump out of the window into
it all! Oh! I must put on my clothes and run out
into it all! I must! I must! I must! George Thomas
is asleep in his basket.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And she dressed herself more quickly than she had
ever done in her life, and, without thinking of asking
leave, she darted downstairs and out of the front
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a few minutes Roma watched her from the window,
doubtful lest the little savage might not, in her
eagerness to possess herself of some of these marvelous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>treasures, root up and trample down Pompous
Pirate’s parterres.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, no. Roma was surprised and pleased to see
the effect their beauty had upon the child, how she
suddenly stood still and looked down on the budding
daffodils, how tenderly she touched them with the
tips of her lingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma called to her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Catherine!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked up, her face full of light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you want to pull some of those flowers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! no! no! I wouldn’t hurt the darling things
for the whole world! Oh, do put on your clothes and
come down and see the sweet things close by!” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now another figure appeared upon the scene—Pompous
Pirate, with a large watering-pot. Seeing
the child on the edge of his parterre, he naturally
enough feared damage to his treasures.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot yo’ doin’ yere, long o’ my f’owers, little missis?”
he demanded, rather crossly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looking at them,” answered Owlet, with the light
of joy fading from her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, min’, now, doane yo’ pull none o’ dem! Doane
yo’ do it! I woane ’low no chillun to ’buse my f’owers.
Year me good, doane yo’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you think I would hurt the dear things you are
not possessed of common sense,” said Owlet indignantly,
as she turned and entered the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma soon joined her in the oak parlor, where the
breakfast table was set. Roma had not witnessed the
scene between the child and the gardener, for she
had turned away from the window at the moment the
man had appeared with his watering-pot; and now
she was too much occupied with thoughts of an impending
interview with Will Harcourt to think of
asking Owlet why she had left the flowers so soon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet, on her part, was no telltale, and so Roma
never knew how the child had been offended by the
servant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Harcourt might be expected some time to-day.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>If there had been no delay in the mail, if her letter
had reached him on time, and if he had acted promptly
on it, and started on the journey to Goblin Hall, he
might reach Goeberlin by the eleven o’clock train.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Ceres came in with the breakfast tray Roma
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you to send Pontius to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A few minutes later, while the lady and the child
were seated at breakfast, the man came in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you to go with the carriage to meet the
eleven o’clock train at Goeberlin. I expect a visitor,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ ef de wisitor doane come by dat train, mus’ I
wait fo’ de fo’ train?” inquired the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you must come back; and in that case I will
send Puck to meet the four,” said Roma, who knew
one weakness of her factotum, and did not wish to
expose him to temptation by allowing him to remain
in reach of strong drink for five idle hours in the
village.</p>

<p class='c009'>That morning Roma could settle herself to nothing.
So she gave herself up to the pleasure of the child,
and walked with her through the old-fashioned garden,
with its affluence of rose bushes, shrubs, vines,
and flowers of every description, though only the earliest
were now in bloom, with its many sorts of sweet
herbs and its many small fruits, the whole garden
fenced in by a thick hedge of raspberry bushes, now
in full blossom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet looked at them with amazed delight, turning
her enchanted eyes from the white blooming hedge of
raspberry bushes to the white blossoming bed of
strawberry vines, and murmuring softly to herself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what glory! what glory! what glory!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma could walk beside her and take care of her,
but could scarcely enter into sympathy with her. Her
anxiety grew more and more intense and absorbing
as the morning wore on toward the hour at which she
might expect the return of the carriage with Will
Harcourt. That would, at the latest, be at half-past
twelve.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>She had ordered dinner to be ready as early as two
o’clock, thinking that would be better than a luncheon
for the tired traveler.</p>

<p class='c009'>At twelve o’clock she led little Owlet back to the
house, and leaving the child to amuse herself with her
pup, sat down at one of the front windows that commanded
a view of the avenue leading to the house,
to watch for the approach of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently she saw the carriage coming. All her
powers of self-control could not lessen the violent
beating of heart and brain, or dispel the cloud that
came over her sight, or still the tremor of her whole
frame.</p>

<p class='c009'>She left the window and hurried to the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>The carriage drove up the avenue and drew up before
the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no one in it!</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment the strong woman grew faint with
disappointment and dark foreboding, but with an effort
she recovered herself, and recollected that he
might yet come by the 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> train, or even by the
10 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> The coachman got down from his box and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dere wasn’t nobody at all got out’n de keers at
Goeberlin, mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you remember to call at the post office?” inquired
the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sartin, mist’ess, an’ fetched dis letter—on’y one
letter, an’ no papers nor pamfits. W’ere did I put dat
letter ag’in?” inquired the man, in perplexity, as he
searched pocket after pocket in vain, while Roma
stood waiting—consuming with anxiety.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yere it is, arter all, in de linin’ ob my hat!”
exclaimed Pompous, finding the letter and handing it
to his mistress.</p>

<p class='c009'>She knew the handwriting. It was Will Harcourt’s.
It was the first communication he had made to her
since that night of their wedding day, when he had
left her on the threshold of their home at Guyon
Manor House to attend Hanson to the boat, as she
thought, but after which he was mysteriously lost to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>her and to all her friends, until he had suddenly appeared
at Lone Lodge. And even this communication
had only been made on her own demand.</p>

<p class='c009'>What would it be? Was he coming to her, and
when? What would he say? Would she get to the
root of the mystery which had separated them, and
thrown her, bound and captive, into the hands of
Hanson?</p>

<p class='c009'>These thoughts rushed tumultuously through her
mind as she seized the letter, hurried upstairs to her
own room, locked the door, threw herself into a chair,
tore open the envelope, and read:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>Lady</span>: I cannot come. I cannot explain. I am
accursed from your presence forever, into the outer
darkness of absence and silence.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>W. H.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Roma gazed at these lines in a trance of amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>What could they mean? What was the mystery?</p>

<p class='c009'>Still she could think no evil of him. It seemed impossible
for her to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the worst of all,” she said; “this is the
very worst of all. My poor Will is insane. I can no
longer hide the truth from myself. Insane, and under
some strange delusion of which that villain Hanson
took advantage. Oh, Heavenly Father!” she moaned,
as a dark cloud of despair gathered over her spirit,
“help him in his great need, and help me! I must not
break down now. I must be strong. Yes, I must be
strong, and—patient.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='c007'>A MISSING YACHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In New York yachting circles there had been much
wonder and speculation as to the whereabouts of William
Hanson’s fine, fast-sailing cutter, the <i>Roma</i>, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>nothing authentic had been heard of the yacht or her
owner since the last week in the preceding November,
when she was reported to have sailed from Washington
for the Isle of Storms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many conflicting rumors were afloat concerning her
and him, some to the effect that he had sailed for the
Mediterranean, others that he had gone to the Caribbean
Sea; and still others that he was cruising off the
coast of South America.</p>

<p class='c009'>All agreed that the irresponsible young fellow had
really gone off to “parts unknown,” without taking
the trouble to advise any one of his intended destination.</p>

<p class='c009'>His stepmother and her family were so accustomed
to his eccentric movements and utter negligence of all
domestic ties, that they scarcely gave the matter a
thought, very indifferently taking it for granted that
he knew how to take care of himself, and that he was
perfectly safe—somewhere!</p>

<p class='c009'>But they were all wrong—sportsmen, friends and
family.</p>

<p class='c009'>To go back a little.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Hanson recovered from his intoxication, to
find his captive flown, and himself made a prisoner
of the elements on the Isle of Storms, entirely cut
off from communication with all the rest of the world
by the loss of the boats, which had been carried away
in the terrible tornado of November 17th, he felt a
certain grim sense of humor in the irony of a blind
fate that had reversed his condition from that of a
jailer to that of a captive.</p>

<p class='c009'>He laughed bitterly to think how completely he was
caught in his own trap.</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew, however, that his captivity would be but
temporary; that the captain of his yacht had orders
to bring her down to the Isle of Storms, so as to
arrive there by the twenty-fifth of November, then
only about one week off.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Hanson bore his penance as well as he could
under the circumstances, looking forward to the time
when his white-winged sea swan should be seen off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the isle, and he should go on board and sail away—not,
indeed, to the Orient, with the beautiful Roma
Fronde as his bride, but to Washington, to claim her
as his wife, and to demand her surrender by the
friends who might have her under their protection;
for he was firmly determined to resist to the extremity
all attempts that might be made to have the fraudulent
marriage set aside.</p>

<p class='c009'>His sanguine temperament enabled him not only to
hope for but to confide in the certainty of ultimate
success.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had legally married her against all the odds of
fate and fortune, he told himself. Why, then, should
he not hold her as his wife, in spite of her friends,
her lawyers, and herself?</p>

<p class='c009'>He made up his mind, and persuaded himself that
he could have her, and would have her, and assuredly
should have her. And then, like the Sybarite that he
was, he resolved to make the best of his situation on
the isle for the week or ten days he might have to
remain there, and instead of moping and repining, to
“eat, drink, and be merry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not an ill-tempered man, except on the rare
occasions when he came under the influence of wine,
very little of which sufficed to dethrone his reason
and excite him to violence and vindictiveness. He
never was even irritable, except when recovering from
such excesses. At other times his manner, at least,
was amiable.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Roma Fronde had said of him, he was not a
Moloch, but a Belial; not a lion, but a serpent.</p>

<p class='c009'>After that first and only outbreak of fury on the
day of Roma’s departure, he never again threatened
or frightened the two poor old negroes, who were now
his only companions, as well as his only attendants.
He contented himself with keeping them pretty busy
waiting on him, and amused himself with jesting and
jeering at them, and playing practical jokes at their
expense, a course which made the poor creatures’ lives
for the time being a burden to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s fo’ our sins, ’Rusalem, honey! It’s fo’ our sins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>as we is ’libered ober to be tormented fo’ a season
by de han’s ob de ebil one,” Wilet was accustomed to
say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat’s so, chile—dat’s yeally so—but ef de Lor’ on’y
spar’s my libe ’til dis young man go ’way f’om yere,
I’ll try fo’ to be a better nigger, I will,” Jerusalem
would answer; and once he added, with emphasis,
“Yes, indeed, I will, fo’ sho.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yo’ will, fo’ sho; but will yo’ do it fo’ true?
Dat’s wot I wan’ to know,” Wilet said, with unfeeling
irony.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, chile, yo’ oughtn’ fo’ to take yo’ ole ’panion
up so short dat a-way,” he complained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Deed, so I oughtn’; but, fac’ is, we’s bof been
penned up yere in dis islan’ long ob dis aggrawatin’
young marster tell we’s bof gettin’ Ole Sam inter us.
Leastways, I know I is,” Wilet confessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the end of their trial drew near.</p>

<p class='c009'>One fine morning, near the last of November, as
Hanson stood on the brow of the crest, in front of
the Mansion House, with his spyglass in his hand, he
sighted his pretty yacht making directly for the
island.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as he had satisfactorily identified her as
his own craft he hastened into the house, quickly gathered
his outlying “traps” together, and stuffed them
into his valise, rang for ’Rusalem, and ordered him
to take it down to the hall, with his umbrella, rug,
pistol box, cigar case, and other effects. His trunk
had been packed for several days, but it must wait
for stronger muscles than Hanson’s own or old ’Rusalem’s,
or both united, to move its weight down the
stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gwine away, young marse?” inquired the old man
in a tone that he tried his best to make regretful, as
he stood, laden like a hall hat-tree, with many goods
and chattels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Didn’t you see that sail coming down the
bay? That’s my yacht. She is coming for me. I am
going off by her to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“’Deed, I’s moughty sorry to year yo’ say dat, young
marse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You old hypocrite!” laughed Hanson, who was in
the best of humor at the near approach of his deliverance
from captivity on the isle. “You know very
well that you are glad to get rid of me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Deed, de bressed Lor’ knows I is mons’rous sorry
to part long ob yo’, my young marse—I is fo’ sho—I
means fo’ true I is,” ’Rusalem declared, not untruthfully,
for his affectionate heart began to yearn over
the young fellow, who had only given him great offense
on one occasion—“W’en he were bit obercomed
’long ob too much wine,” as he put it. So he was sorry
for the moment, and would not then confess to himself
what a relief the departure of Hanson would be
to himself and his “ole woman, Wilet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took his load of small baggage below, piled it
in the hall, and then went to tell the news to Wilet,
whom he found standing at the kitchen table, making
rolls to put in the oven for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yo’ see dat dere wessel off yonner to de norf,
p’intin’ dis yere way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—wot ail me not to see it? I been watchin’
ob it eber since I been stan’in’ at de table yere, ’fo’
de windy, makin’ my yoles. Wot ’bout it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heap ’bout it. Dat dere wessel ’longs to de young
marster, an’ it comin’ yere to fetch him ’way. He
gwine ’way to-day. He packin’ yup now. Wot yo’
fink ob dat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is dat so?” gravely inquired Wilet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yas! Aine yo’ glad?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Y—a—s—course—I is,” hesitatingly replied the
woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dere! I knowed it! Yo’ aine g’ad! Yo’ aine no
mo’ g’ad nor I am, on’y yo’ doane wan’ to ’fess it,”
chuckled ’Rusalem.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, po’ fellow, yo’ see; but anyways it’s better
fo’ ’im to go. He were a moughty deal ob trouble an’
’sponsibility,” Wilet said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ef I was yo’ I wouldn’ be finkin’ ’bout dat at dis
hour ob partin’,” Jerusalem remarked.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Before Wilet could defend herself from the implied
rebuke the bell rang, and ’Rusalem hastened to answer
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found Hanson standing in the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go and hoist the signal, so that my sailing master
may know where to send out a boat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Young marse, de signal pol’ don been carried ’way
long ob de stohm dat night w’en de boats an’ de boat’-ouse
went; but ef yo’ can fin’ de f’ag I can put it up
lon’ ob a clo’es prop, or sumhows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without a word Hanson turned and fled upstairs,
and soon came down again, with the red flag in his
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Rusalem went around to the rear of the house, and
brought from the shed one of Wilet’s long clothesline
props. Hanson joined him, and together they went
down to the broken pier, dug a hole in the sand, planted
the pole, and hoisted the signal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The yacht was now within a quarter of a mile of
the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>After fixing the signal Hanson stood with his small
telescope at his eye, watching her. After a while he
turned his glass toward Snowden, and started as he
saw crossing from that point a large rowboat.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the eight days that had passed since the storm
had carried off the island boats, and made him a
prisoner there, no boat had come from the mainland,
nor was one expected or hoped for, as there was really
nothing to bring the dwellers on the shore to the Isle
of Storms at this season of the year.</p>

<p class='c009'>What, therefore, should bring the strange boat on
the very morning of the arrival of the <i>Roma</i>?</p>

<p class='c009'>While he was speculating on this question a horn
blew from the direction of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>This had been Wilet’s method of summoning people
who were out of hearing of the bell, to come to
the meal that was then ready.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s breakfas’, young marse. Breakfas’ is yeady,”
suggested ’Rusalem.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I am ready for breakfast,” gayly replied the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>young man, as he shut up his glass and put it in his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yo’s gwine fo’ to leabe us, so I year ’Rusalem say,
young marse,” remarked Wilet, as she stood at the
head of the table, ready to pour out his coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; are you not delighted to hear it?” he inquired,
with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now dat dere is a wery s’archin’ question, young
marse. But I do say, fo’ de trufe, I’m not zactly
’lighted as yo’re gwine ’way; but same time I doane
deny as yo’ sartinly was a g’eat ’sponsibility to me
an’ ’Rusalem, ’specially sence dat dere night w’en yo’
was—was—was—tuk so ill, wid no way ob gettin’ ob
a doctor to yo’. No, sah, no way. But as yo’ gwine,
young marse, I hopes, I des, as yo’ do well, an’ make
up long ob de young mist’ess, an’ let wine ’lone—w’ich
she woone put up wid, as yo’ see yo’se’f. An’ I hope
yo’ bofe will lib togedder in lub, an’ sometimes come
yere to see de ole p’ace in de p’easant summer time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Wilet. I, too, hope we shall,” he answered
as he took the cup of coffee from her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson hurried with his breakfast, yet he had
scarcely finished when old Jerusalem came in and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sah, dere is two boats at de lan’in’, an’ de men
out’n bofe is comin’ to de house. Is I to denounce dem
inter de drawin’-room or inter de kitchen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will go out and meet them on the porch,” said
Hanson, rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>He reached the hall door, which ’Rusalem attentively
stepped before and opened for him, just as the
first men came up—two sailors in the light blue uniform
of the <i>Roma</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>They touched their caps and stood at “attention.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How are you, Coote? How are you, Reeves?” said
Hanson, recognizing both; and then, without waiting
for answer, he said: “Just follow this old man upstairs,
and bring down the trunk he will show you,
and take it down to the boat. Jerusalem, show these
men the way to my room, and then follow them to
the boat with this smaller luggage.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>The old negro beckoned the sailors, and conducted
them to the upper floor, while Hanson turned to meet
the stranger, who had now reached the house, and
was stepping upon the piazza.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are Mr. Hanson?” inquired the stranger, who
held a long envelope in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s my name,” replied the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. William Hanson?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without replying, the stranger handed him the long
envelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson took it, and drew from it a folded paper,
which he opened, and found to be a notice summoning
him to appear as a respondent in the suit entered by
Roma Fronde for the setting aside of the fraudulent
marriage ceremony that had been, without her own
knowledge and consent, performed between herself
and William Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right,” said the young man, with a light
laugh. “I see what it is. I expected this. It has come
in good time to enable me to appear promptly and
put a stop to the antics of my lunatic wife and her
scoundrelly counsel. This is Thursday. The hearing
is set for Monday next. I shall have ample time. Sir,
I would ask you to enter the house with me and take
refreshments; but, as you see, I am just going away.
However, if you will kindly accept the hospitalities
of Guyon Hall at the moment of its master’s enforced
departure, my servants are at your orders, and will
make you comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Mr. Hanson. I always feel quite at
hame in the old house, having known it and its proprietor
from youth up. I will go in and taste some
of old Aunt Wilet’s applejack or cherry bounce. Don’t
let me detain you,” said the officer.</p>

<p class='c009'>And with a bow he passed the usurper and crossed
the threshold.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson stepped after him, and took his ulster from
the peg and drew it on.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Rusalem came downstairs, followed by the two sailors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>bringing the heavy trunk, which they carried
out of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Rusalem gathered up the smaller baggage and went
after them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson had just finished buttoning up his ulster,
and was drawing on his gloves, when Wilet made her
appearance through the back door, complaining:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’s a-massy on me, young marse, wot I done to
yo’ fo’ yo’ to be gwine ’way ’dout biddin’ a body good-by?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was not going to do anything of the sort. Besides,
I have left you some tokens of my regard which
you will find up in my room—a dozen or so of assorted
mufflers, silk and worsted, of all colors, as many large
linen or silk pocket handkerchiefs, a half bushel of
mixed gloves, socks, slippers, etc. These last you may
not be able to wear, but the mufflers and the handkerchiefs
will be beauty and joy to you forever. And
here—here is something to get you a winter outfit.”
With this, he handed her a twenty-dollar gold piece,
which took away her breath. The scamp, bad as he
was, could be liberal, perhaps because he had more
money than he knew what to do with.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I yeally do t’ank yo’, a hundred t’ousand
times, young marster!” she fervently exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One time will do. Now, good-by. Don’t let your
husband tyrannize over you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Him! Po’ ole ’Rusalem? He! he! he!” laughed
the woman. “He knows better ’an to ’tempt it! W’y,
he’d no mo’ dare to get ’toxified an’ carry on dan he’d
heave hisse’f inter de fire! ’Deed, ef ebber I cotched
him at sich I’d make him fink de debil had got him
sho. He taranize ober me! He! he! he! Yo’ make
me laugh, young marster. Not but wot I lubs an’
’specks ’Rusalem. He is one good, true ole man. Dat
he is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t doubt it. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by, young marse. Gib my lub to young mist’ess
w’en yo’ sees her, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. Good-by!” said Hanson, for the last
time, as he hurried out of the house and ran gayly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>down the hill, whistling an air from “The Marriage
of Figaro.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the landing he found the boat already laden with
his luggage, and ’Rusalem waiting to see him off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, old man!” he called, and the patriarchal negro
came up, and took off his hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here is a token of my deep regard for you,” he
said, and put a double eagle into ’Rusalem’s hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old negro bowed very profoundly, but said nothing.
Such munificence deprived him of the power of
speech for the moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, good-by. And here! Harken to a little parting
advice. Don’t you let your wife tyrannize over
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>’Rusalem drew himself up with all the dignity of a
“lord of creation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who, sah?” he demanded. “Wilet? No, sah! Wilet
know her dooty too well, sah. I is de sup’eem
yuler in my fambly, sah. Wilet no mo’ fink ob yunnin’ ’way
offen de islan’ ’dout my leabe, dan she would
jump inter de sea. No, sah! She knows wot she’d
cotch ef she did! No, sah. I’s lord an’ marster ob
dat ’oman! Yes, sah, I is fo’ sho—I mean fo’ true.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson laughed to think how utterly dependent was
this sable and self-deceived “supreme ruler” on his
wife, for counsel, assistance, and everything else he
needed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“T’ank yo’ berry much, sah, fo’ yo’ moneyifficence,
an’ likewise yo’ good ’vice. Gib my dooty to de young
madam, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will,” said Hanson as he stepped into the boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The men laid themselves to their oars, and, rowing
swiftly, soon cleared the distance between the island
and the yacht.</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain was standing on the deck to welcome
the owner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad to see you, sir!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So am I to see you, Gamble,” Hanson answered,
as he reached his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But where is the bonny bride?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“Oh, she is with friends in Washington. I am
going to her now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And not to the Mediterranean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, afterward. But, Gamble, what is the meaning
of those clouds rising in the west? They have a
strange, uncanny look.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, they have. They indicate ugly weather.
I was just thinking we had better run into Snowden
Inlet and anchor for the night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense! The <i>Roma</i> can weather any storm that
could ever rise. We must sail for Washington immediately.
I have no time to lose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The impatience of a young husband is excusable,”
laughed the captain, and he went forward and gave
the necessary orders—fatal orders, they proved to
be!</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Roma</i> sailed away from the Isle of Storms, and
that was the last seen or heard of her, or of her owner,
for many days.</p>

<p class='c009'>I must be brief here.</p>

<p class='c009'>The terrible storm struck them at midnight, near
the mouth of the bay. The small crew worked and
struggled heroically with wind and waves, but to no
purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Roma</i> foundered at sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson, his captain and crew barely escaped with
their lives by taking to an open boat, in which they
were tossed about all night in the tempest, and from
which, when it was about to break up under them,
they were picked up by a merchant ship, bound from
Baltimore to San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus it happened that while Hanson’s friends were
speculating as to what course his pleasure cruise on
the <i>Roma</i> had taken, the yacht was at the bottom of
Chesapeake Bay, and her owner, with all her crew,
was bound on a long, compulsory voyage around Cape
Horn, and was suffering the tortures of the damned
through seasickness, cold, wet, exposure and deathly
peril.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not until the first week in April that the
ship reached San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Hanson had not a cent of cash with him, but he
had boundless credit. By this he obtained money
enough to pay off his captain and crew and to make
preparations to return to Washington by the overland
route as fast as steam, by day and night, could
carry him.</p>

<p class='c009'>All through his long journey the question that
racked him was:</p>

<p class='c009'>How should he find Roma?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI<br> <span class='c007'>ON HER TRACK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Hanson, having traveled day and night, reached
Washington city on the morning of April 15th.</p>

<p class='c009'>Naturally inferring that Amos Merritt, her late
guardian, and her counsel, would be the most likely
to know Roma’s present abode, Hanson only took
time to engage a room at an East End hotel, change
his clothes and eat his breakfast, before he threw himself
into a hack and drove to the old lawyer’s office.</p>

<p class='c009'>On entering, and inquiring of the clerk in the anteroom,
he was told that Mr. Merritt was in his private
office, and alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Declining the clerk’s offer to take in his card, Hanson
went and turned the knob of the communicating
door and entered the rear room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merritt was sitting in his leather armchair, before
his desk, not waiting, but leaning back and reading
the morning paper. It was still early, and he had
not settled to the day’s work.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked up on hearing the unannounced entrance
of the visitor, probably taking him to be one of the
clerks, coming on official business, as they frequently
did.</p>

<p class='c009'>On recognizing Hanson he started, flushed purple
with indignation, and then, without laying aside his
paper or rising from his chair, he demanded:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“To what cause, sir, may I attribute the insult of
this intrusion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson possessed much cool self-control, and more
dignity than he had any moral right to show.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took a chair, and seated himself, without leave,
and with quiet insolence, and replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have come to inquire for my wife. Where is
she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your—wife, fellow? What wife? How should I
know anything about your wife? I was not even
aware that you had set up a wife. May I ask what
misguided woman was idiot enough to marry you?
Accept my congratulations,” said the lawyer dryly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know very well, sir, that I allude to your
former ward. Miss Roma Fronde, who became my wife
on the fifteenth of last November,” Hanson said with
cool insolence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or, rather, whom you sought to marry, without
her knowledge or consent, by the basest fraud that
ever was practiced upon human being. That fraudulent
marriage ceremony was set aside by the courts
as illegal, therefore null and void,” Mr. Merritt explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was a pity, for the lady’s sake, even more
than for mine, when it is remembered that she went
with me as my bride to the Isle of Storms,” Hanson
said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She went to her own house, sir. To the house of
which she was the heiress and the mistress. You
stole into that house without her knowledge or consent,
like a sneak thief at midnight. You afterward
broke into her room like a murderous burglar. She
had you at her mercy. Your life was in her hands,
at her disposal. You had forfeited your life to her
by every human law. Yet she did not take it. She
spared you for the Lord’s sake. Without hurting you
she escaped. She saved herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who will believe that?” scornfully inquired Hanson.
“Really, Mr. Merritt, if the court has decided
that the rites by which Roma Fronde and myself were
united were informal, illegal, I think their decision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>is very compromising to the lady, who lived with me
as my wife for——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get out of my office, you low beast, before I pitch
you out of the window!” exclaimed the lawyer, starting
to his feet, and growing purple in the face. “Go!”
Hanson went.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had no wish for a personal encounter with the
stalwart old lawyer, even if it had not been possible
to end in breaking his own neck out of a three-story
window.</p>

<p class='c009'>He next drove to the West End Hotel, where Roma
and her friends had been in the habit of stopping while
in Washington. Here he wisely inquired for the lady
by her maiden name, knowing full well that she had
never acknowledged his.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Fronde?” repeated the office clerk. “Yes, sir,
she was here with the Grays, last November. Mr.
Gray was appointed consul to Delicome, and sailed
for Liverpool about the twenty-second of the month,
I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did Miss Fronde accompany them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir. She went to the new apartment house on
the Mount Pleasant Road—the Wesleyan Flats. She
was there for some time, I know. She may be there
yet,” added the clerk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you for the information,” said Hanson, and
he left the hotel, re-entered his hack, and gave the
order:</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the Wesleyan Flats.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Twenty minutes’ drive brought him to the building.</p>

<p class='c009'>He got out and entered the hall, the door of which
stood open.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you tell me whether Miss Fronde is staying
here at present?” he inquired of our friend Tom, who
was on duty there as hall porter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She dun lef’ mo’ ’an a week ago,” answered the
boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where has she gone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dun know. Down de country somewhurse. She
writ it on a keerd an’ guv me, but mammy’s got it, an’
I’s forgot.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Can I see the landlord?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dun know nuffin ’bout no lan’lor. Yo’ kin see
Missis B’own, I yeckon. She ’ten’s to eberyfing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then take my card to Mrs. Brown,” Hanson said,
handing over the slip of pasteboard.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy disappeared within the elevator, which was
about to rise to the upper regions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson walked up and down the hall for about
five minutes, at the end of which time Tom reappeared
with a message to the effect that Mrs. Brown would
see the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson followed the boy to the elevator, which
rose to the top floor of the house, on which Mrs.
Brown’s “sky parlor” was located. It was a plainly
furnished room, with a Kidderminster carpet, horsehair
chairs and sofa, and windows overlooking the
whole city, the Potomac and Anacostia rivers, and
the wooded hills of Maryland and Virginia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Brown, the same stout, compact woman of
medium height, with fresh complexion, black eyes and
black hair, clothed in a dark woolen suit, as I have
before described her, rose from her chair and came
forward with outstretched hand to meet the visitor,
saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad to see any friend of Miss Fronde.
She endeared herself very much to us all during the
four months she remained with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was here four months, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. Sit down, pray.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson took a seat and Mrs. Brown resumed her
own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Fronde was the bosom friend of my sister,
and something nearer and dearer still to myself,” said
Hanson, with an air of claiming the lady as his betrothed.
He dared not go further than that then, for
he could not know how much or how little this Mrs.
Brown might know of Roma’s position.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, indeed, sir!” exclaimed the janitress. “I am
delighted to hear it. But how is it that we never saw
you here all winter?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“I have just returned from a long sea voyage, a voyage
of many months.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! And to think Miss Fronde never mentioned
your name to me! But then some young ladies are so
reserved,” said Mrs. Brown meditatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and she among the most reserved. I expected
to find her in Washington, but it appears that she
has left the city. Can you tell me where she has
gone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, sir. She has gone to her own country
seat in Maryland—Hobgoblin House, I think they call
it. But I will tell you who can give you exact information—Lawyer
Merritt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Humph! He was a great friend of Miss Fronde, I
believe?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, sir; a very great friend indeed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a frequent visitor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, sir; of course. He had been her guardian
and trustee, and he managed all her business for her.
But, of course, sir, if you are engaged to the young
lady, you know more about these matters than I do,”
Mrs. Brown added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I did know, but I have been away so long.
Many changes may take place in five months,” Hanson
said, very gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Brown broke into a merry little laugh, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I see just how it is with you. You are jealous
of Miss Fronde’s old guardian. Why, sir, you
might as well be jealous of her great-grandfather, if
she had one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson took no notice of this innocent raillery, but
inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did Miss Fronde go alone to Goblin Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who went with her?” demanded Hanson, turning
hot and cold at the thought of Harcourt as her possible
companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not Mr. Merritt, certainly,” slyly replied the janitress.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Who, then? Who, then?” eagerly demanded Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A much younger and more attractive companion,
of whom the young lady is excessively fond,” Mrs.
Brown replied, smiling mischievously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who was he?” demanded Hanson, rising from his
chair in excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who said ‘he’? I didn’t. There was no ‘he’ in the
case. What are you thinking of, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who went with Miss Fronde to Goblin Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A little girl; her adopted child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” exclaimed Hanson, dropping back on his seat
in a state of collapse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who did you think had gone with her, sir?” merrily
inquired the janitress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not know what to think. So she has adopted
a child, has she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, sir; a bright, quaint, interesting little girl
of about five years of age.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whose child was it? How came Miss Fronde to
adopt it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was the child of a poor, friendless and destitute
young widow, who died of consumption here about
two weeks ago. Oh, I must tell you all about that
poor woman and her child, and what an angel of
mercy Miss Fronde was to them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson assented, not because he was in the very
least degree interested in the objects of Roma’s benevolence,
but because in hearing them he should
hear more of her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They occupied a room in the rear of this upper
floor—one of the cheapest rooms in the building.
There are no registers up as high as this. You see,
sir. I have an open grate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it is pleasanter,” said Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, but in those little rooms there were no
such things; only little iron stoves, that mostly
smoked, being so near the roof. Even for this poor
room she could scarcely pay the rent, and only managed
to do it by half starving herself, living on bread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and tea. Fancy a young woman in consumption living
in such a way as that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very sad,” said Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I really do not know what would have become of
her if Miss Fronde had not found her out. She took
her out of that cold, smoky room, and brought her
downstairs to her own luxurious apartments, and
made her comfortable there. Miss Fronde had the
finest suit of rooms in the building. And then she
came to me to see if she could engage commodious
rooms for the sick woman and child; but it was in the
thick of the season, and there was not a vacant bed,
not to say room, in the whole house; and I told her
so, and advised her to send the young woman to the
Providence Hospital and the child to the orphan asylum.
And what do you think she answered me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure I don’t know. Something quixotic, no
doubt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She said—that angel did—‘The dying mother and
her child are devotedly attached to each other. It
would be cruel to separate them now, and it would
probably hasten the death of the young woman. Besides,
they both cling to me, as to their only friend,
in a manner that is very pathetic.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The instinct of self-preservation,” said Hanson
curtly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then,” continued the janitress, “she asked me:
‘Mrs. Brown, do you think that you would send your
own sister to a hospital, under such circumstances,
if you had the means of taking care of her at home?’
I was forced to confess that I would not. Then she
said: ‘No more will I send this poor sister woman
away from me while I have, as I certainly now have,
the means of taking care of her at home, even though
it is but a temporary home.’ And then what do you
think that angel of yours did, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something equally quixotic, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She gave up her own elegant parlor to the invalid
and the child. She supplied them with every possible
comfort and luxury. She engaged the best medical
attendance the city could supply, and she nursed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>woman herself, both night and day; and not only
nursed her, but read to her, talked to her, and entertained
and amused her. I do believe she would have
taken her to Florida to try to save her life if she had
been able to travel. She was all in all to that young
woman as long as the poor thing lived.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What detained Miss Fronde so long here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That young woman did. Miss Fronde meant to
have gone to the country in December, but the poor,
sick creature was not able to travel, so the young lady
stayed here with her. The woman got so much better
in her new, luxurious quarters, with the skillful medical
treatment and the tender nursing and cheerful
companionship, that Miss Fronde began to talk about
taking her to the country as soon as the spring should
open, if she should then be able to travel. And I
know that the poor widow looked forward to going
there as to going to Paradise. I don’t think, however,
that there are many young beauties and heiresses
spending a winter in Washington who would
have given up all society for the sake of nursing a
poor, consumptive fellow creature.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was very extravagant benevolence,” said Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I told her. ‘Miss Fronde,’ I said, ‘if you mean
to do for every forlorn human being all that you are
doing for this mother and child, you will have your
hands full, and need the fortune of Vanderbilt ten
times told.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did she say to that?” inquired Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, sir, she looked at me with such a grave, sweet
smile, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘But I am not required to “do” for all the “forlorn.”
The poor are freely distributed around and
about the rich throughout the world. Every one who
has the power to relieve is responsible for the suffering
that comes under his notice. Just at present I
am only required to take care of these two poor, helpless
creatures. I do not find them a grievous burden,
I assure you. The Lord has not demanded of me
more than I can well perform.’”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“How long did this state of things continue?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you, sir, that the young woman died about
two weeks ago. She was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery.
Miss Fronde paid all the funeral expenses and
adopted the orphan. I have often heard that childless
people often love their adopted children as well
or better than if they had been born their own. I do
think this was the case with Miss Fronde. Young as
she was, she took to this little five-year-old orphan
as if she had been the widow, and it was her own
and only child. Yes, sir, it is wonderful to see. Her
heart is just wrapped up in that mite. I really do
think it would grieve her to death if she were to lose
it. I did wonder at it; but I said to myself it is because
she is alone in the world—not knowing anything
about her engagement to you, sir, you must
recollect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When did Miss Fronde leave here for Goblin
Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nearly two weeks ago, sir; a few days after the
funeral.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Taking the child with her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. I told you so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And no one else?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir. I told you that also.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Had Miss Fronde any visitors while here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No gentlemen visitors?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, there you are again! You men are so awfully
jealous! No, sir, she had no gentlemen visitors, unless
you call her old guardian, who came on business,
and the old doctor who attended the sick woman, visitors,
and both of them were over sixty years old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever hear Miss Fronde speak of a young
gentleman friend of hers, of the name of Harcourt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir, never; nor of no one else—not even of
yourself, sir. Miss Fronde, good and kind as she was,
was very reserved—very much so, indeed, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mrs. Brown,” said Hanson, rising, “I am
very much indebted to you for all this information.
Now I will ask you but one more question, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>bid you good-morning. Do you think that Miss
Fronde intends to keep that child with her at Goblin
Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed; I don’t only think it, I know it. She
said so. I hope you will make no objections, sir. It
would break her heart to part with that child now,
though, of course, after she marries, and has children
of her own, she will not be so much wrapped up in
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably not. Well, good-morning. I am off to
Goblin Hall by this evening’s express train. Have
you any message for Miss Fronde?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please give her my best love and respects, and
ask her, if she should visit Washington city on her
bridal tour, to be sure to come to stay at this house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will. Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson left the room and went down with the elevator
to the ground floor, where he entered the restaurant,
took a seat at a table, and ordered a lunch.</p>

<p class='c009'>While he leisurely discussed his oysters and ale he
thought over all that he had heard, and formed his
plans upon the information.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt had not reappeared upon the scene of
Roma’s life. So much was certain. She was alone
at Goblin Hall, comforting her lonely heart with the
love of her adopted child—some miserable little waif,
offspring of some unknown woman, picked up in an
apartment house. He did not even know the name
of the child or the woman. He could not remember
whether the janitress had ever mentioned those names,
nor was he sufficiently interested in Roma’s protégées
to try to recollect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet, my reader, if Mrs. Brown had chanced to call
that mother or child by name Hanson would have
been so thunderstruck that he would not have forgotten
the circumstances, for, as the personal advertisements
say, he would have heard “something to his
advantage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>However, this much he knew—that his rival was
out of the way, departed for parts unknown; that
the Grays were all in Europe; that Roma was at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Goblin Hall, unprotected, except by her own strong
self, and alone but for the presence of her pet child
and her own servants.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he determined to go down to see her there, to
try to reconcile her to himself; and in the event of
her obstinate refusal, to warn her that he should
make an appeal to have the decision of the court that
set aside their marriage ceremony as illegal reversed
in his favor, on the ground of his compulsory absence
from the trial. And this appeal he would make in
any case. If she should still be obstinate in her determination
to repudiate him he would find means to
wring her heart so cruelly that she should be compelled
to yield to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>With this resolution he finished his lunch, paid his
bill, went back to his hotel, packed up again, and sent
off his luggage by express to Goeberlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later he ate dinner, settled with the office clerk,
and started for the six-thirty express train to Goeberlin.
He caught it, and was soon flying westward on
his evil errand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='c007'>ROMA’S DESPAIR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Roma strove bravely to resist the dark cloud of
despair that was fast settling down upon her soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>She could not concentrate her thoughts sufficiently
to enable her to read or write, and to attempt to
knit or to sew was to leave her mind too free to fly to
themes which to dwell upon was maddening.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under these circumstances she devoted herself to
Owlet, and found some distraction from her sorrow
in the society of that strange child.</p>

<p class='c009'>She began to teach the little one to read and to
sew, and gave two hours of the morning to this pleasant
pastime. She found Owlet an apt and eager pupil.
After the hours of tuition she would take her to walk
over the plantation. She took her through those wonderful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>orchards, now in full blossom, that seemed to
the child like forests of pink and white flowers. She
showed her a pigeon box, with the young pair of
pigeons in the nest, and she told her wonderful stories
of the carriers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet enjoyed all this with more intense delight
than any child reared among such scenes, or having
a less sensitive nature, could have felt.</p>

<p class='c009'>But through all her own pleasure Owlet perceived
the deep trouble on the face of her benefactress, and
responded to it for some days in silent sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length, one morning, after she had said her
lesson in spelling words of three letters, she suddenly
demanded, while looking wistfully into the lady’s face:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma looked surprised, then lifted the child to her
lap and kissed her in grave silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what is the matter with you?” again inquired
Owlet, with tender, persistent interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still Roma did not answer, but gently caressed the
little one. How, indeed, could she answer the question?
She could not tell the facts, for the child could
not understand them; nor could she use the formula
for such cases made and provided, and say: “Nothing
is the matter,” or “I have a headache,” for neither
statement would be true, and Roma was too purely
truthful to prevaricate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have I hurted you? And are you too kind to scold
me? Oh, you know I am very often naughty, and not
respectful enough to people; but—but—that is only
when—when I’m not possessed of common sense, you
know. But, oh, I do love you! And I am so sorry
if I hurted you!” Owlet exclaimed, clasping her benefactress
around the neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have not hurt me, darling; you never do,”
gently replied the lady, returning the caress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t I? I’m so glad! But somebody has been
very wicked to make you so sorry. Who is it? Aunt
Serious?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s awful. I thought it might have been her.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Oh, no, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then was it Uncle Paunchus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Owlet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s very aggravating, too, sometimes, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he has not displeased me, nor has any one
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then who was it? That is what I want to hear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You would not know, dear, if I were to tell you,”
gently replied the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if I don’t know who it was, I do know one
thing,” said Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is that, dear?” Roma inquired, with a grave
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know whoever it was that hurt you is not possessed
of common sense, and I would not mind ’em if
I was you,” concluded Owlet with solemn conviction.</p>

<p class='c009'>While she spoke, Puck, the mail messenger, entered
the room with the mail bag, which he handed to his
mistress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma opened the bag and emptied its contents upon
the table before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was quite a heap of letters. She hastily
looked over their superscriptions and postmarks, and
recognized them by their handwriting. There was a
letter from her late guardian, Lawyer Merritt, letters
from Mr. and Mrs. Gray and from Abbot Elde.</p>

<p class='c009'>She opened Mrs. Gray’s letter first, saw at a glance
that the writer and all her family were well, and then
laid aside that and all the accompanying foreign letters,
to be read at more leisure, and opened Mr. Merritt’s
letter, which was a very bulky one, for the envelope
inclosed two others, one in the handwriting
of Margaret Wynthrop, addressed to Amos Merritt,
Esq., and the other in that of Reba Bushe, addressed
to Mrs. William Harcourt, care of Amos Merritt, Esq.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer’s letter contained only a few lines, to
the effect that he forwarded the inclosed, adding a
remark that Hanson’s stepsister was evidently still
in utter ignorance of Roma’s true position, and believed
her to be the wife of Will Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma hastened to open and read Miss Wynthrop’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>letter, in the hope of hearing some good news of the
Harcourts. It was, however, but a short note, seemingly
in answer to an inquiring one from the lawyer,
and informing him that Mrs. Harcourt’s condition
remained unchanged, and that Mr. Will Harcourt had
left Goblin Hall for the North, but not giving the
young man’s address, which, by the way, was not
known to the writer.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a deep sigh Roma laid this letter aside and
took up that of Reba Bushe.</p>

<p class='c009'>This also was very short, and somewhat reproachful,
complaining that the writer had written at least
half a dozen letters to her beloved Roma, addressed
to the Isle of Storms, via Snowden, but that she
had not received a line in acknowledgment of any
one of them; that she was almost discouraged from
further attempts to keep up the correspondence between
herself and her old schoolmate and bosom
friend; but, being on the eve of sailing for Liverpool
with her mother, she made this last venture in the
hope of hearing from her friend, and should address
the letter to the care of Mr. Amos Merritt, who would
be likely to know her address in the event that Mr.
Harcourt and herself had left the Isle of Storms for
some other place. The letter concluded with entreaties
for a speedy reply, and assurances of the writer’s
unchanged and unchangeable affection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor Reba! Dear Reba! How little she knows of
my real position, of the irreparable injury done by
her evil stepbrother to Will Harcourt and myself.
What must she think of my seemingly selfish neglect
of her? And how shall I answer her letter without
exposing her brother and giving her the deepest mortification?
On the other hand, if I do not write to
her, she will think me cold and careless, and that
alternative would give her equal pain,” Roma said to
herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then to the waiting negro boy she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must be ready to take letters to the afternoon
mail. Now you can go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy ducked, and departed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“Darling,” Roma whispered gently to the listening
and attentive child, “I have important letters to write,
and I cannot take a walk with you to-day. But you
may go in the garden and play, if you choose. You
will be quite safe there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The child kissed her benefactress, slid off her lap,
and ran out of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma opened and read the letters of her relatives
from Delfcome. They were full of praises of their
new home, new friends, new scenes and new life altogether,
and of prayers and petitions to their dear
Roma to come out and join them immediately. Nothing
but the presence of their beloved Roma was needed
to complete their happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma read all these letters with the deepest interest,
but she answered that of Reba Bushe first. She
began by writing:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your dear and most welcome letter received to-day
is the very first I have had from you, my beloved
friend, since parting with you, nearly six mouths ago,
at the steamboat pier in Washington city. I can
easily understand why the many letters you have written
to me within the last half year, previous to this
one, have not reached me. But though I do so well
understand this, I cannot explain it to you. I am
in deep trouble, almost in despair, yet must not tell
you why—at least, not at present. The time may come
when all shall be made clear. In the meanwhile, trust
me, my beloved friend, and always think of me as your
true and loving</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Roma</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“That letter,” said Roma to herself, “will reveal
nothing of which she ought for the present to remain
in ignorance. She will think that my dear Will has
fulfilled all Aunt Ruth’s dark predictions, of which
she caught an echo when she was with us before the
wedding. She will think that he is insane; and, ah,
me! she may not be far wrong. She will be sorry for
me, and she will write to me; but, let us see—she
must not direct her letters to Mrs. William Harcourt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>here. It would be embarrassing; nor can I tell her
not to do it without giving her the explanation that
it is impossible now to give. I must add a postscript
to that letter of mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She drew the sheet toward her, and wrote:</p>

<p class='c008'>“P.S.—Direct all your letters to me under cover to
Mr. Amos Merritt, Louisiana Avenue, Washington.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she wrote a short note to her late guardian
and present attorney, merely saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“My old friend, from whom I have no secrets, I
reinclose Miss Bushe’s letter, with my answer to it.
You will readily understand my policy. You will
please receive all the letters that she may write to
me, and inclose them to me as in this instance. Please
mail my letter to Miss Bushe from the Washington
post office.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She placed the two letters in the same envelope
with this note, and addressed the package to Mr.
Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having done this, she went to work to answer her
foreign letters.</p>

<p class='c009'>While Roma was so engaged her little protégée,
with her double-funnel hat on her head, wandered
away into the delightful garden, which, to her apprehension,
was a very Garden of Eden.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a very large garden, covering quite a quarter
of an acre. It was formally laid out in squares,
like the streets of the Quaker City. But its luxuriant
growth of shrubs and fruit bushes along every
walk between vegetable beds, hid all angles. It was
entered by a south gate leading to the broad middle
walk that ran the full length of the ground to the
north wall, which was entirely hidden by a thick
hedge of raspberry bushes, now a mass of white blossoms.
On the right of the gate, as you entered, in
the southeast corner of the wall, was a group of three
peach trees, now in full, pink flower. All through the
garden, here and there, where they would not interfere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>with the growth of vegetables or flowers, were
isolated fruit trees—pear, quince, apple, plum and
cherry trees. In the walks near the house was an affluence
of roses over arbors and trellises, and around
the edges of the vegetable square, further away, pot
herbs and small fruits took the place of the flowers.
But now, not only all the spring flowers and all the
roses were in bloom, but all the fruit trees and bushes
and vines were in full blossom, and the whole garden
was one outburst of beautiful color. In the morning
the birds sang there in a concert of joy and praise.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was now near midday, and they were silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet wandered down the middle walk, between
the borders of sweet williams, larkspurs, ragged robins,
hyacinths, jonquils, daffodils, tulips—and countless
varieties of old-fashioned spring flowers, stooping
lightly to caress one or another, but never plucking
any, and so came at last to the gooseberry bushes,
in full bloom, that grew on the borders of a sidewalk
on her left.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was not the gooseberry bushes that attracted
the child. It was what seemed to her to be a flock
of little, soft, round, yellow birds running about in
the grass, and in and out, under the bars of a wicker
coop, in which something was moving and making a
gentle noise.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was, in fact, a coop, with a bantam hen and
a brood of newly hatched chickens, which the poultry
woman had brought from the poultry yard, for some
reason best known to herself, and placed in the gooseberry
walk.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Owlet did not know what they were. Her face
grew radiant with delight, and she threw herself on
the ground near them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you dear, darling things!” she said, taking the
little, round, yellow puffs tenderly in her hand and
putting them up to her face. “You sweet, lovely
things! I do love you so! You are so sweet, I could
eat you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, p’ease, p’ease doane bite ’em! Dey is sich po’
itty sings!” pleaded a baby voice near her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Owlet looked up, and saw a small negro child standing
by her side. It was a strange little human—a
child of about her own age, but shorter and plumper
than she was, with a skin as black as ink, yet, strange
as it may seem to say it, beautiful in face, feature
and form, with a well-shaped round head, covered
with jet black, silky, closely curling hair, large, soft
black eyes, deeply fringed on both upper and lower
lids, with long, curly black lashes; a small nose,
not very flat; a lovely mouth, a perfect Cupid’s bow
in shape, and dark crimson in color, not too vivid a
contrast to the black skin. But, after all, the chief
beauty of the little face was its expression of more
than human tenderness, of a ray of almost heavenly
love. She was clothed in a short garment of blue
serge that left her shapely little black arms and legs
perfectly bare from shoulders to hands and from knees
to feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet, however, gave her a mere glance that did
not take in the perception of her personality in the
least degree, and indignantly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not possessed of common sense. Do you
suppose I would hurt these dear, darling little
things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Surprised at the angry glance and voice of the white
child, the little black one looked dazed and dumb
for a moment, staring at the speaker; then she softly
drew nearer to her, gently laid her hand upon her,
and tenderly inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is oo sick, ’ittle dirl?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The first impulse of our small woman was to fly
into a passion and demand to know whether the questioner
was possessed of common sense. But the heavenly
compassion shown on the little black face utterly
disarmed and subdued Owlet, so that after gazing
for a little while she only inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What made you think I was sick?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I doane know, but I sought oo was, an’ I so sowwy
fo’ oo.” And with her little black hand she stroked
Owlet’s cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Oh, you darling thing! You are prettier than the
flowers and sweeter than the birdies!” said Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dese aine birdies; dey is chickies,” said the little
negro.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are sweeter and prettier than the chickies,
then. You darling thing! What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Docky,” replied the black child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ducky? Oh, Ducky, I love you! Ducky, darling!
Ducky, darling!” exclaimed Owlet, suddenly throwing
her arms around the black child and kissing her.
“You are a Ducky darling. You shall be my little
playmate. Come to the house with me now, and see
my dear lady. I want to show you to her, and I want
to show her to you, as well. Come,” continued Owlet,
clasping the hand of the black child and drawing her
along.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dorcas, commonly called Dorky, followed obediently,
as she would have followed anybody anywhere on
so kind an invitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet drew her on out of the garden, into the
house, into the oak-paneled parlor, and into the presence
of Miss Fronde, who had just finished writing
her letters and was putting them into the mail bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma raised her eyes as the children entered the
room hand in hand, and for a moment she thought
what a pretty picture they made, standing thus before
her; but only for a moment, as Owlet exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look! This is Ducky Darling. And, oh! isn’t she
sweet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, it is little Dorcas!” exclaimed Roma. “Where
did you find her, Catherine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the chicken coop, in the garden,” replied Owlet.
“And, oh! ain’t she lovely?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What were you doing in the garden, Dorcas?” the
lady inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chickies,” briefly answered the little black child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is your mammy, Dorcas?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doane know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is Ducky Darling, anyhow? Who is the dear
thing?” Owlet inquired, with the deepest interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is Hera Hutter’s child,” Roma replied.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“And who is Hera Hutter?” persisted Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is our poultry woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where does she live?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a little house near the poultry yard,” said Roma,
as she rang a little hand bell that stood on the table
by her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Puck answered the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go and find Hera, and ask her to come here,” said
the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy went out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Catherine, you said that you found Dorcas in the
garden, by the chicken coop? Surely you must be
mistaken, dear. The chicken coop had no place in
the garden,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I was not mistaken. I couldn’t have been if
I had been possessed of common sense. The chicken
coop was in the gooseberry walk, and the old hen
was in the coop, poor thing! And the chickies were
running in and out. And I took the dear, pretty things
up in my hands, and Ducky Darling came up and
saw me, and was afraid I was going to hurt them, and
that was how I found Ducky Darling, the sweet
thing!” Owlet said.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment Hera entered the room, courtesied
to her mistress, and stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman was short and plump, with a skin as
black as that of her child, with features almost as
pretty, and an expression almost as pleasing. She
was neatly clothed in a dark blue calico dress, a white
apron, white neck handkerchief and white turban.
She was the wife of Nace, and the mother of five
small children, two older and two younger than Dorcas,
and with only one year between each child and
its successor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sent for you, Hera, to take charge of your little
one here. She ought not to be allowed around
the place at large. It is not safe for her,” said Miss
Fronde, speaking very kindly, as she always spoke
when obliged to rebuke her servant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’, Miss Yoma! She wa’n’t yoamin’ at no large.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>I pit her inside ob de garden gate wid my own han’,”
Hera replied, smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why in the garden?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Caze she c’azy arter dem young chicks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! this is what I wish to know. Why did you
put the chicken coop into the garden?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To keep the little chicks out’n harm’s way, Miss
Yoma. Yo’ know dat ole brack shanky yooster?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The shanghai, do you mean, Hera?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat’s him. He so unnateral an’ so rawenous, he
like to ’a’ gobbled up all dem young chicks. He’d ’a’
done it, too, ef I hadn’t took ’em out’n harm’s way
an’ pit ’em into de garden, in de goozebewwy walk,
’tween de peas an’ de beans, whey nobody aine got
no call to go dis season ob de yea’, w’en none ob dem
fings is fit to yeat,” Hera explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I suppose you were right. You know your
business best. You may go now,” Roma said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hera courtesied, and took the hand of little Dorcas
to lead her away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! no! Please don’t take her back! Let her
stay with me!” pleaded Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, miss. Little colored gals aine comp’ny fo’
little w’ite ladies,” Hera replied, leading her child
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not possessed of common sense! Why
ar’n’t they? What do you mean?” indignantly demanded
Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell her, Miss Yoma, p’ease, ma’am. She woane
min’ me,” said Hera.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not myself sure of what I ought to tell her,”
said Miss Fronde, with a faint smile. “But, if you
have no objection, Hera, you may leave Dorcas for a
little while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ’co’se I’s no ’jections, Miss Yoma, on’y I doane
wan’ her to bodder yo’. Min’ yo’, Dorky, yo’ ’have
yo’se’f fo’ de w’ite ladies, yo’ hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Es,” said the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ Miss Yoma, p’ease, ma’am, yo’ sen’ de chile
home soon’s ebber yo’ git tired ob her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, Hera.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>So the mother went out, leaving the child with
Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>And that day they had a glorious time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet amazed and delighted Ducky Darling with
the sight of her picture books and toys, but among
them all the little black child was the most enraptured
with a small musical box, so that when at
length she was claimed to be carried away by her
mother, Owlet raised her to the height of bliss by
giving her the box.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='c007'>A THUNDERBOLT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Early the next morning, when Owlet was taking
her usual run in the garden before breakfast, she
found the little black child in the gooseberry walk,
sitting down by the chicken coop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Ducky Darling, I am so glad to see you again!”
Owlet cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chickies,” replied the child, with a broad smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; they are such dear, sweet things! Everything
is sweet, Ducky Darling, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Es.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A bell rang.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the breakfast bell. I must go into the
house. Won’t you come in and have some breakfast?”
Owlet inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“B’ekfus’ ’lon’ o’ mammy,” said Dorcas.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! You mean you have had yours?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Es. B’ed an’ mi’k an’ ’lasses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what a nice breakfast! Well, I will go now,
but I will run out again before I sit down to my lessons.
You stay here and wait for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Es. Chickies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet ran into the house and joined her benefactress
at the breakfast table, which was set near the
open windows, through which the morning air came,
laden with the scent of hyacinths.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Lady,” began Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you call me aunty, dear?” inquired Miss
Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet looked at her solemnly, and replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If any one but you had asked me such a question
I should say they were not possessed of common
sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—why?” Roma questioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Cause you are not an auntie. The old colored
people are aunties, but you are a young white lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I stand rebuked. What were you about to say to
me, ma’am, when I was so rude as to interrupt you?”
inquired Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was going to ask you if you wouldn’t please let
Ducky Darling learn lessons along with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This seemed rather a startling proposal, but a suggestive
one. There were about fifteen adult negroes
on the plantation, none of whom could read or write.
There were about twenty growing children, none of
whom knew a letter. Roma had never given a thought
to this state of things. The child’s question aroused
her conscience. Here was a field of work and of duty,
indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady, why don’t you answer me? If you won’t
let Ducky Darling come in here and learn along with
me, tell me so, and I’ll take my primer and go out
in the garden and learn my lesson along with her,
and teach it to her, too,” said Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, you may bring Dorcas in, and we will
begin with her. I really do not know whether I can
teach her anything. She does not appear to be very
intelligent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Roma had quite finished her speech Owlet
had darted out of the room. In a very few minutes
she returned with the little black child, who waddled
into the room very much in movement like her namesake,
the duck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are going to learn to read, Ducky Darling!
To read about all the pretty birds and beasts and
things in the picture books I showed you,” said Owlet,
as she helped the child to climb up on the chair, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>much too high for her that her little black legs stuck
straight out from the front of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is an experiment,” said Roma, as she took a
card with only three capital letters on it—A B C—and
put it in the hand of Dorcas, and told her the names
of the signs, making her repeat them over and over
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady, don’t you take so much trouble. I can teach
her the three letters and learn my own lesson, too,”
said Owlet, drawing another chair close by the side
of the one occupied by Ducky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma took up her knitting, to which she had lately
taken, as men take to cigars, or some women take
to pipes, for the sedative effects, and she sat down
in her easy-chair and knitted while she watched her
pupils. Owlet was very zealous, and Ducky very docile,
but the experiment was not a success—then, at
least.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of the two hours, which was the limit
of the day’s learning, it was found that Owlet had
paid so much attention to her little companion that
she had not got her own lesson, while Ducky had
chewed up her A B C card, in spite of all her little
monitor’s vigilance.</p>

<p class='c009'>For all the rest of the day Owlet made Ducky Darling
her inseparable companion, with the exception of
the hour when Hera came to carry off her child to
her early dinner, only to discover later that Ducky
Darling, immediately after her meal, had waddled
back to the “big house” to join her friend, whom she
never left until night, when she was again recaptured
by her mother and carried off to supper and to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day was Sunday, the first Sunday after
Roma’s return home.</p>

<p class='c009'>The morning was glorious—a jubilee of heaven and
earth; the world flooded with sunshine; woods, groves
and gardens in full leaf and blossom; the grass starred
with daisies; the air full of the fragrance of flowers
and the songs of birds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will go to church to-day,” Roma said to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>little protégée, as they sat together at the breakfast
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To church? Oh, that will be good! I never was
at church in all my life. Mamma used to go to early
mass, sometimes, but she never took me,” Owlet exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall go now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And may Ducky Darling go, too?” anxiously demanded
Owlet. “I haven’t seen the dear thing to-day.
She wasn’t in the garden with the chickens—she
wasn’t anywhere. But may she go to church with
us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dorcas has gone to Wheatlands with her father
and mother and all the children, to spend the day
there, with some of their relations,” replied Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! That was the reason why I could not find
her, the dear thing. Where is Wheatlands?” suddenly
inquired Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About three miles from this place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is Wheatlands? Is it a city or a depot?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a large tobacco plantation owned by relations
of mine, who are now in Europe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, dear, you must get ready for church,”
said Roma, and she rang the hand bell, that soon
brought Pompous Pirate to her presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you to put the white cob to the pony chaise,
and have it at the door in half an hour. I shall drive
myself and this child to church,” said Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, ma’am,” said the negro, with a deep inclination
of his head as he left the room to obey the
order.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma called Owlet to follow, and went upstairs to
put on her bonnet and mantle. Independent Owlet
buttoned on her own black cashmere jacket, but surmounted
it by the inverted funnel hat, and considered
herself dressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must wear the little black bonnet, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I hate the black bonnet, and I love my little
hat that I have worn for years and years and years—the
dear old thing!” Owlet expostulated.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“But, my love, you are wearing black for your dear
mamma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I don’t see the sense of it. If poor, dear
mamma had gone to the dark world I would wear
black all the time, and never be happy no more. But
darling, pretty mamma has gone to the bright world,
and anybody who wears black for an angel in the
bright world can’t be possessed of common sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That settled the question. Whenever the Owlet
promulgated her ultimatum she got her own way, and
so, on this Sunday morning she wore her old double-funneled
brow straw hat, looking more like a little
devil in a pantomimic scene than ever before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Often Roma felt that she failed in her duty by not
rebuking this wayward imp, but there was such sterling
truth and honesty in the child, such an inherent
constancy to her own convictions of right and wrong,
and, withal, such an innocent unconsciousness of giving
offense, that Miss Fronde felt that it would be
very difficult to set her right. She privately resolved
to submit the problem to the judgment of Rev. Dr.
Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Roma and her protégée appeared at the front
door they found the pony chaise, with the white cob
harnessed to it, standing before the house. Pompous
Pirate stood at the horse’s head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better leave me dribe yo’ young mist’ess,” said the
man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not this time, Pontius. Take Ceres to the meeting-house
she is so fond of. Now lift Miss Catherine
into the chaise,” Roma said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Roma got in, sat down, took the reins, and
started the cob.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet shivered and shook herself with delight as
they went rolling along the avenue, between rows of
sweet-scented flowering locust trees, and out of the
broad lawn gate on to a road through the woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! this is dee-licious! I am so glad you didn’t
have Uncle Paunchus to drive!” she exclaimed, with a
little shudder of joy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Don’t you like Uncle Pontius?” inquired Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” Owlet admitted. “I like him well enough,
but he is so awfully big. It sort of crowds one just
to look at Uncle Paunchus. Besides, it is so nice and
cozy for you and me to be driving through this heavenly
place all by ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Their road wound up and down, over wooded hills
and through fertile vales, with glimpses of farmhouses,
fields and orchards here and there, until at
last, on the outskirts of the village, they came to the
church, in the midst of its large, well-shaded, parklike
grounds, differing only from a park in the gleaming
white gravestones scattered here and there among the
trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here were gathered many carriages, of every description,
from the donkey cart to the family barouche,
and horses which were unharnessed, and tethered, so
that they might nibble the fresh, luxuriant grass
while resting from their labors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma drew up, alighted, lifted the child to the
ground, and was about to take her horse from the
shafts and tether him to a tree, when a voice sounded
behind her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear young lady, I am so glad to see you—so
surprised and delighted! Let me do that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned and saw her own family physician standing
there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Dr. Keech! So happy to meet you!” she exclaimed,
giving him her hand, which he shook heartily,
and retained in his grasp longer than necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the organ from within the church began to peal
forth with the opening voluntary, and she added, by
way of hastening the release of her hand:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And thank you very much. You may, if you please,
do this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Doing “this” meant unharnessing and tethering the
cob, which the doctor quickly effected, while Roma
stood by, holding the hand of Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who is this young lady?” inquired the doctor,
as the three turned to walk toward the church.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is Catherine Nouvellini, a little ward of mine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>You must come to the Hall and make her acquaintance.
She is quite worth cultivating, I assure you,”
Roma replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no doubt of it,” the smiling old doctor replied,
patting the shoulder of the child. It was impossible
to pat her head with such a church steeple
of a hat as she elected to wear. “I have no doubt of
it. I shall do myself the honor of calling on Miss
Nouvellini, or should I say the Signorita Nouvellini
or Mademoiselle Nouvellini?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But they were entering the church, so the doctor
got no reply to his “chaff,” and fortunately did not
hear the muttered criticism of Owlet as to his probable
deficiency of common sense.</p>

<p class='c009'>The church was not crowded, but on this fine morning
it was full—every pew having its quota of occupants.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma led little Owlet up the right-hand aisle to
her own pew, which was in the corner, to the right of
the pulpit. She was scarcely seated when the rector
came in from the vestry and took his place at the
reading desk.</p>

<p class='c009'>The services commenced and proceeded in the usual
form of the ritual, and the sermon which followed
was excellent in moral and religious instruction, “if
people would only live up to it,” as the good old lady
remarked concerning the doctrine of total depravity.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Owlet, for the first half hour she was as
quiet and solemn as her namesake’s most ancient surviving
ancestor; the second half hour she grew restless
and fidgety; during the third half hour she
yawned without the least attempt at disguise, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah-h-h me!” startling the sexton, who was seated
near her, and waking several old women who were
decently dozing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma gently shook her head at the delinquent, and
by so doing made matters worse, for the imp excused
herself by saying, in an audible voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I hadn’t said ‘Ah me!’ I should ’a’ busted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she tried to conquer her restlessness and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>keep quiet, and, indeed, she became very quiet, for
her good intentions were rewarded by a sound sleep
that lasted until the benediction was pronounced, and
the people began to leave their pews.</p>

<p class='c009'>After all the congregation had left the church Roma
still remained in her pew, to wait for the opportunity
of speaking to her dear old friend and pastor,
Dr. Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had gone into the vestry to lay off his surplice.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as he reappeared, in his black suit, Roma
came out from her pew, leading little Owlet, and went
into the chancel to speak to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He advanced with outstretched hands, took hers
affectionately, and, shaking them gently, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear child! I am so happy to see you. I had
no idea that you had come back until I saw you in
your pew to-day. When did you arrive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only on last Tuesday, dear doctor, and as glad to
get back to you as you can be to see me,” cordially
replied Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right! right! right! my child! But who is this
little one?” inquired the rector, taking the hand of
Owlet in his own and looking tenderly down into her
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Catherine Nouvellini is a young ward of mine. I
hope you will come to see us soon, and hear all about
her, and teach me how to do my duty by her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will come, my child; be sure of that. You are
going to remain among us now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not going abroad to join your friends?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear that. ‘Dwell among your own
people,’ Roma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will come to see me soon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I will not detain you any longer, dear friend.
You must be fatigued with this long service. Indeed,
you should have an assistant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The parish can’t afford it, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you are being worked to death!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Well, it is better to rub out in labor than rust out
in laziness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you needn’t do either,” put in Owlet. “No,
nor you won’t, neither, if you are possessed of common
sense. ‘There’s reason in roasting eggs.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector looked astonished. Then, as he turned
to look at Roma, and met her glance, his eyes twinkled
and his mouth twitched with suppressed mirth; it
would not be seemly to laugh out loud then and there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid she has a cavity where her bump of
veneration ought to be, Dr. Shaw, but you will help
me to train her properly. Come, Catherine, we must
go,” said Roma, anxious to get the child away before
she should have another chance of expressing her
opinion. “Good-by, dear Dr. Shaw. I shall expect you
to dinner to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Roma. I will be there. Now, I would
not really let you hurry away if I did not know by
instinct that many of our friends are waiting to speak
to you outside. Good-by, my child. Good-by, my small
monitress,” said the rector, warmly shaking hands
with Roma and then with Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the two found themselves outside the
church door they were surrounded by a crowd of
Roma’s old friends and neighbors, who showered welcomes
upon her, and questions about the Grays, and
their life at Delfcome; and when these were satisfactorily
received and answered, came inquiries concerning
her little companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>To all these last Roma gave the same answer that
she had already given to the physician and to the
rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length she was free to return home, and very
glad when she went to her pony chaise, attended by
Dr. Keech, who harnessed her horse, lifted little Owlet
into the chaise, assisted Roma to her seat, and gave
her the reins.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he stood with old-time courtesy, hat lifted,
until the young lady drove off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma felt a strong disposition to give Owlet a lecture
on good behavior, but refrained, partly from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>reluctance of the strong and powerful to hurt in any
way the weak and dependent, and partly from despair
of such a lecture doing the child any good.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they would have driven home in silence but for
the prattle of Owlet, who, refreshed by her long nap
in the church, was wide awake, and keenly alive to
the delights of the drive over the wooded hills and
through the fertile vales that lay between Goeberlin
and the Hall, on that fine spring day.</p>

<p class='c009'>So at length they reached home in time for their
early afternoon dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this Owlet went out, to wander through the
garden, with no companion but her bull pup, George
Thomas, leaving Roma to read alone until the child
was called in to supper and to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day the rector came, early in the forenoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he rode up to the house on his easy-going old
brown mare he saw Owlet walking on the lawn, with
her shadow, Ducky Darling, waddling by her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had just got through their morning lessons,
which in the duckling’s case had been quite as unsuccessful
as those of the preceding Saturday—her
notions of imbibing knowledge being to chew it up.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister dismounted, tied his horse to a post,
and came up to the children.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Miss Catherine, how do you do?” he inquired,
patting Owlet’s cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pretty well, I thank you, sir. How do you do
yourself?” inquired Owlet, on her best behavior.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This,” said Owlet, introducing the duckling, “is
Ducky Darling. And, oh! isn’t she just too sweet for
anything?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Shaw smiled benevolently, and patted the little
curly head of the black child, who responded to the
caress with her lovely smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma had seen the arrival of her pastor, and came
out to meet him.</p>

<p class='c009'>They shook hands cordially and then went into the
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma had intended on that day to tell her old friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the story of the great fraud that had been passed
upon her and the strange position in which she found
herself in regard to her betrothed, Will Harcourt; but
the subject was so painful, and so calculated to give
pain, and the old rector was so happy in the return
of the favorite of his flock, that she forbore to mar
his enjoyment. Some other time would do as well,
she thought, and so she put off the revelation to “a
more fitting season.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector took an early dinner with her and her
little ward, and went away early in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma sat on the vine-clad front porch of her house,
knitting, and watching the play of the two children
on the lawn, when, happening to look down the locust
avenue, she saw a man approaching the house, whom,
to her disgust, she recognized as Hanson.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='c007'>SIEGE AND DEFENSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Calling all self-controlling powers to her aid, Miss
Fronde started up, ran down to the lawn, took the
children each by a hand, hurried them into the house,
and shut and locked the door, and without a word of
explanation to the astonished little ones, who stood
staring at her, she dropped into a chair, and thought
rapidly, as strong-minded women do think in emergencies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where did Hanson come from? What had brought
him here? During the five months she had stayed
in Washington she had neither seen nor heard from
him. He had given no sign of his existence to her
nor to any of her friends. He had not responded to
her suit for the setting aside of the fraudulent marriage
ceremony, and since the decision of the court,
which declared that ceremony null and void, and set
her free, he had seemed as much lost to the world
as if he had been dead.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>But had he been keeping her in view all this time,
while she remained in Washington, and had he only
waited until she came home to her remote and secluded
old country house, where he might suppose
her to be unprotected, and at his mercy, that he had
hunted her so quickly to her retreat? She was only
five days from Washington, and he had found her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next moment she heard his step upon the porch
and his knock at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>She started then.</p>

<p class='c009'>He must not be allowed to come in, she decided at
once, and to keep him out the door must be kept shut;
for though he would not be rude unless he had been
drinking wine, yet he was very suavely insolent, and
quite capable, if refused admittance, of politely pushing
past old Pompous and gracefully forcing himself
into her presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>This must be prevented.</p>

<p class='c009'>The knocking was repeated with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma went and withdrew the key from the lock
and put it into her pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Pompous now came strutting through the back
door, and along the hall, to “make the entrance free.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The knocking was reiterated with impatience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Loramity! Dey can’t wait a minute, whoeber dey
is, an’ I comin’ as fas’ as I can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pontius! Stop!” said Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yas, youn’ mist’ess. Des lemmy open de do’ fuss.
Dey’s comp’ny out dere,” said the man, hurrying on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do nothing of the sort! Stop! I command you!
Follow me into the parlor, and listen to what I have
to say. Come, children,” said Miss Fronde; and pushing
the little ones gently before her, she entered the
sitting-room, closely attended by the huge negro.</p>

<p class='c009'>The knocking grew loud and peremptory.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous started impulsively to open the door, but
recollecting his mistress’ prohibition, he hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind the noise. Listen to me,” said Miss
Fronde severely. “The person who is knocking out
there is Mr. William Hanson, who came here one summer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>with his stepsister, Miss Rebecca Bushe. You
remember him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’, yes, youn’ mist’ess. I ’members ob him good—a
werry nice-spoken gemman, an’ werry libbal, too.
Gimmy fibe dollars w’en he went ’way,” exclaimed
Pompous, making another start to answer the knocking,
which was repeated at intervals.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stay where you are and attend to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous stopped and stared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That man is not to be admitted on any account.
Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A—a—a—we-dem not to leabe him come inter de
house?” doubtfully inquired the stout negro, with eyes
and mouth wide open with astonishment that any
visitor should be denied admittance within the hospitable
doors of Goblin Hall, and especially that an
old friend should be turned ignominiously away.</p>

<p class='c009'>The knocking was resumed, much more loudly than
before. Pompous looked distressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lemme do somefin’ or yudder, youn’ mist’ess. ’Deed
an’ ’deed it do makes me nerbous to year all dat
knockin’ at de do’, an’ me stan’in’ yere doin’ nuffin
w’en I’s so used to open de do’,” said the elephant,
trembling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell you what to do, and first, why you are
to do it. The man has disgraced himself. He is not
fit for the company of decent people. He should be
in the penitentiary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“De Lor’!” ejaculated Pompous.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Therefore, do not open the front door, for the villain
is quite capable of pushing past you and forcing
himself into my presence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Youn’ mist’ess,” said Pompous, slowly drawing
himself up, “ef yo’ ’nounce de word as he is not to be
’mitted inter dis house, he better not try dat yacket
on me. Ef he do, he’ll jes’ fink a ton o’ bricks has
fell on him, he will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very likely; but I wish to avoid a scene. Go,
therefore, out of the back kitchen door, around the
house, and meet him on the outside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, youn’ mist’ess; an’ wot mus’ I tell him?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Nothing from me. Just order him to leave the
premises.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But ef he ax arter yo’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Refuse to answer any questions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ef he gimme his keerd?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Refuse to take it. Tell him to go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But s’pose he ’clines to go, ef he is sich a gran’
willyun?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unchain Tiger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Loramity, youn’ mist’ess! Tige would kill he!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep the chain firmly in your hand. I do not wish
to have the wretch torn to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I mus’ on’y t’reaten ’im, to sca’ ’im, like? But
den ef he ain’t sca’ one bit, an’ ’fuse fo’ to go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then loose the dog on him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Loramity, youn’ mist’ess! Dat dog yeat her dinner
offen him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I hope it won’t give her a fit of indigestion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Youn’ mist’ess, ’taine no joke. ’Deed, Tige is a
wusser sabbidge debbil now she’s a-nussin’ ob her
pups, dan ebber she was ’fo’. She’ll mucilage dat po’
sinner!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man takes his life in his own hands when he
trespasses on these premises. The dog is here to
guard them. If Hanson does not go when he is told
to go, he must take the consequences,” said the young
lady impatiently. “But there is not the slightest danger,”
she added; “the man has an excellent pair of
heels, and will use them. He is a champion runner.
Go, now, and send him away—peaceably, if you can,
with the dog at his heels, if you must,” Roma concluded,
as she sank down in her easy-chair, watched
by the two children, who stood, hand in hand, before
her, awed into unusual stillness by the strange excitement
of their “lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma took no notice of them. She was too deeply
absorbed in her own profound indignation to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous strutted solemnly out of the room, and
out of the back door of the kitchen, which he carefully
closed behind him. He was in great trouble. The
agonizing question with him was this—if he should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>have to loose that beast on that man, and she should
kill him, should he, Pompous Pirate, be hanged for
it? He feared he should. He had only obeyed his
mistress’ orders, but the law was very “onsartin,”
he reflected, gloomily shaking his head. This brought
him around to the front of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson was standing on the porch, looking about
him while waiting for his knock to be answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two men recognized each other instantly, simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you are there, are you?” exclaimed Hanson.
“I have been knocking here for the last ten minutes.
It began to look as if there was nobody at home. How
do you do, Pontius?” and Hanson held out his hand
in a friendly manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous took it as a matter of policy, but was
immediately instigated by the evil one to tell a falsehood.
He never felt the least conscientious scruple
about lying, especially in the cause of “peace and quietness,”
when he deemed mendacity a merit. Now
he thought if he could persuade this unwelcome visitor
that Miss Fronde was neither in the house nor
in the neighborhood he would leave both without
giving any trouble. So he answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“So dere aine nobody at home, sah. De famberly
all gone ’way, an’ de house shet up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I know the Grays and Eldes are in Europe,
but your mistress—where is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous drew himself up portentiously and rubbed
his forehead. He was not ready with the details of
his falsehood. He was huge and slow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you answer me?” impatiently demanded
Hanson. “Where is your mistress?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sah. To be sho. Dat’s so, sah. De youn’
mist’ess, sah. Yas, sah. De youn’ mist’ess hab gone
to Wash’town, sah. Yas, sah,” Pompous finally replied,
with a grin of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had got his story all right now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your mistress gone to Washington?” demanded
Hanson with a slight smile.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Yas—yas, sah, to Washin’town city, sah. Yas, sah.
It’s de sollum trufe, fo’ a fac’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Pontius!” exclaimed Hanson, with a laugh.
“Where do you expect to go to when you die, if you
tell such stories?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stories, sah!” exclaimed the negro, drawing himself
up and pushing himself out. “I ’clar’ ’fo’ de
Lor’——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now don’t ruin your soul by swearing to a falsehood.
You know it is a story, and I know it is a
story. As I came up the avenue toward the house
I saw your mistress standing on the front porch, with
two children on the lawn below. When she saw me
she ran down, took the children, led them into the
house, and locked the door after her, just as I reached
the steps.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous rubbed his head in sore perplexity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yo’ say yo’ seed de youn’ mist’ess on de poach,
sah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mus’ be ’staken, sah. Mus’ ’a’ been Sister Sarious
you seed dere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! The colored housemaid?” demanded Hanson,
half amused, half indignant at the impudence of
the negro.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yas, sah. Dat’s so, sah. Yo’s puffeckly yight, sah.
It were Sarious as yo’ seed dere wid dem chilluns,
jes’ as yo’ say, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you dreadful old humbug!” exclaimed Hanson
with a laugh, “I said nothing of the sort. I said
it was your mistress whom I saw on the porch. Do
you hope to persuade me that I mistook a negro
woman, as black as the ace of spades, for the fair
lady of the house? The devil fly away with you and
your impudence. It was your mistress whom I saw
plainly on the porch when I was close to the house.
Now, what do you mean by telling me that she has
gone to Washington?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous rubbed his forehead in dire perplexity.
Then, with characteristic facility, he immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“tacked,” and, putting his hands together with persuasive
earnestness, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sah. Dat’s berry true, sah. But I finks as
yo’ didn’ pay ’tention to w’at I were sayin’, sah. No,
sah, I sho yo’ didn’ year wot I were sayin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what in the deuce were you saying?” demanded
Hanson, provoked and impatient, yet amused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was a-sayin’, sah, as de youn’ mist’ess hab been
to Washin’town, sah. Yas, sah, been, sah, not gone,
but been, sah. Yas, sah; been to de city dis long time
pas’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And has just got home?” quickly added Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous cocked up his head sideways, like some
huge bird, and answered, dubiously, in a noncommittal
manner:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ef yo’ say so, sah, it aine no manners to conterdick
yo’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, since the lady is at home, go around and
let me in, and take my card to her,” said Hanson, producing
a little slip of pasteboard from his breast
pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I darsen’t do it, sah. I darsen’t, ’deed. W’ich my
o’ders is strict, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your orders?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yas, sah. To ’quest yo’ to ’part peaceable, sah.
Yas, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” exclaimed Hanson, flushing red to his forehead.
“Are these your mistress’ orders?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’ich dey is, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did she send me any message?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’ich she did not, sah,” replied Pompous with dignity,
“but des to sen’ yo’ ’way. Sich is my o’ders,
sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! But suppose I decline to go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No ge’man, sah, as is a ge’man, would ’cline to
leabe a lady’s house w’en he is onwelcome an’ ’quested
so fo’ to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if I have the right to stay and demand admittance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat yo’ can’t hab, sah. An’ ef so be yo’ ’fuses to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>leabe de place quiet an’ ’spec’ful, my o’ders is werry
sewere. Yes, sah, dey is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what may they be, pray?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To loose Tige on yo’, sah,” solemnly replied the
negro.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tige? Who’s Tige?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her aine a ‘who’; her is a what.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is Tige, then?” demanded Hanson with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her is a doag, an’ de werry fiershisht an’ wishusest
beas’ as ebber yo’ see, sah. A pu’ mung’el her is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A pure mongrel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yas, sah; a werry pu’ mung’el.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think I ever heard of that peculiar breed
of dogs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Likely not, sah. Dey is werry yare; werry yare,
indeed. An’ dis Tige is one ob de yarest. Yas, sah,
her is. Her’s got mastiff an’ bulldog an’ Wushun
bloodhoun’ an’—an’—an’—less see, now,—some yudder
sort ob sabbage b’ute wishuser nor all de res’.
Yas, sah, I sho yo’. An’ all dat go to make Tige de
mos’ tore down debbil as ebber libbed. She wouldn’
min’ killin’ a man mo’n she would killin’ ob a yat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you have orders to loose dat brute on me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’ich I has, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a savage that sweet love of mine is!” muttered
Hanson to himself. Then aloud he said: “I
have the right to enter this house. Go around and
open the door for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’ do it, sah. No, not at no yate in dis yere
worl’,” repeated Pompous, solemnly shaking his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell you, you idiot, that I have the right to enter
this house and insist upon an interview with its mistress.
Yes, and the right to remain here as its master.
The lady is my wife. You are my servant. Go,
and obey my commands, or neglect them at your
peril.” Hanson changed his tone from light jesting to
grave authority.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the huge Pompous, though deeply impressed
by his words and manner, was not influenced in the
direction Hanson wished. On the contrary, Pompous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>drew himself up and pushed himself out with solemn
dignity, and answered with contemptuous indignation:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yo-o-o? Now, sah, yo’ is offen yo’ head.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go, and open the door for me!” exclaimed Hanson,
losing temper and self-control at the same moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now yo’s offen yo’ head fo’ sho; ’f’aid yo’s been
jinkin’ too f’ee, sah. Now, I ’wises ob yo’ to ’part
peaceable, ’fo’ I hab to onchain dat dere wil’ beas’
wot aine got no ’spec’ fo’ nobody, an’ ’ould chaw a
ge’man soon as she would a beef bone, an’ ’joy one as
much as tudder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the devil with you and your dog. Go open this
door, or it will be the worse for you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’ do it at no price wotsomever. Now, take
my ’wice, sah, an’ go w’ere yo’ got yo’ likker, an’
sleep it off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You impudent fool! What do you mean?” angrily
demanded Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, sah, yo’s c’azy junk! Dere’s no use mincin’
ob de matter; yo’s mad junk. De wil’ way yo’ hab
been talkin’ ’bout de youn’ mist’ess bein’ ob yo’ husban’—leastways,
I mean yo’ bein’ ob her wife, proobes
it. No, sah, take good ’wice, an’ go w’ere yo’ got de
likker, an’ s’eep off de ’fec’s ob it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You confounded donkey! Understand that I shall
stay here until I shall be admitted into the house
I have the right to enter as its master and yours,”
said Hanson angrily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s awful junk,” muttered Pompous to himself,
“junker dan I fus’ f’ought. I’ll hab to gib him one
good scare ’long o’ Tige!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then aloud he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Yo’ll stay here tell yo’ get ’mitted into de
house, will yo’, sah? Den I shall hab to loose de doag,
’cordin’ to o’ders.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Loose all the bloodhounds on the place, you insolent
villain! I shall not stir from this spot!” savagely
exclaimed Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All yight, sah. Ef yo’ wants ’em. Des as yo’ say.
Dough I do fink as Tige will be much as yo’ can stan’,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>said Pompous loftily as he strutted off to the kennels
muttering to himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll des gib him one good scare, anyway. Dough
I doane mean to loose Tige on him, sho ’nuff, Lor’,
no. I doane want to kill dat po’ intoxified creetur,
nor likewise be hung fo’ de likes ob he. No, ’deed.
But I’ll gib him one good scare,” he concluded as he
reached the kennels and unchained the brute and
brought her around to the front of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was a terrible-looking creature, a huge black
beast, with a bull head, fiery eyes, heavy jaws, strong
fangs, great shoulders, thick limbs and sharp claws.
She glared at the stranger with burning eyes and
showed all her teeth with a deep, thunderous growl.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous held her chain with all his strength, and
it took all his strength to do it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson was no coward, and he gazed at the monster
with the interest aroused by a strange specimen
of cross breeds in fierce canines. Nor did he for one
moment believe that the negro would dare to loose
the brute, that would be sure to fly at the stranger’s
throat, throttle him down, and finish him. He smiled
in derision of the man who held the dog.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beast crouched, sprang, and nearly pulled the
heavy negro down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, sah,” said Pompous, “will you leabe here like
a ge’man, or will I let de doag loose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you open the door for me?” inquired Hanson
coolly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sah; couldn’t, not at no yate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I will stay here until you do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den I’ll hab to let Tige loose, sah, an’ her wouldn’
min’ killin’ yo’ mo’ ’an ef yo’ was a yat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The brute growled like subterranean thunder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You insolent idiot! Do you dare to suppose I am
afraid of your dog! Let her loose!” scornfully exclaimed
Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>The monster reared and plunged, and nearly pitched
his keeper headforemost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, de Lor’ ’a’ messy on my po’ soul! Wot shall
I do? My orders was to let her loose on to yo’, sah,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>ef so be yo’ didn’ go peaceable w’en yo’ was tol’ so to
do,” said Pompous, in an agony of doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you zany, why don’t you obey your orders?”
demanded Hanson with a scornful laugh at the negro’s
distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are limits to human endurance of insult.</p>

<p class='c009'>That laugh settled the question; the aggravating
irony of Hanson’s expression sealed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous drew himself up and swelled himself out
with solemn dignity as he inquired, in a tone of
gloomy reproach:</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ do yo’ s’pose, sah, as I’m gwine to be hung fo’
de likes ob a ’toxified sinner like yo’ is?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sah, I hol’s de doag offen yo’, sah; I spares
yo’ libe, sah; I gibs yo’ time fo’ ’pentance, sah; an’
I hopes yo’ll make good use ob de time I gibs yo’, sah;
it’s de trufe, fo’ a sollum fac’; an’ so I takes my doag,
an’ leabes yo’, sah—leabes yo’ to yo’ own ’wices, sah.”
And Pompous strutted solemnly away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on!” Hanson called after him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous turned around.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who were those children I saw with your mistress?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“De yittle brack gal were Hera Hutter’s chile.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind her. The little white one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“De yittle w’ite gal were a pet orphin, wot de youn’
mist’ess ’dopted to fetch up; yes, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your mistress is very fond of that child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is, sah,” Pompous replied with curt dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will do. Give my respects to your mistress,
and tell her that she shall hear from me again, and in
another way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’ do dat, neider, sah, no mo’ ’an I could take
in yo’ keerd. My o’ders is to fetch no messidge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No matter. She shall hear from me all the sooner,
and all the more to the purpose,” muttered Hanson
as he turned away from the house, walked down the
avenue, and got into the railway hack that was waiting
for him on the outside of the gate.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Pompous led his dog back to the kennels, saying
to her in an apologetic tone:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knows yo’s disapp’inted, po’ doag. I knows yo’
wanted to chaw dat willian. But I darsen’ lef’ yo’,
Tige. De law is so onsartin. Ef I had lef’ yo’ chaw
him it might ’a’ hung me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He put the beast in with her pups and turned and
walked leisurely toward the house. Pompous seldom
compromised his dignity by hurrying; perhaps he
could not, on account of his immense weight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I gwine tell my youn’ mist’ess how I sca’ dat
’truder ’way,” he said to himself as he entered the
presence of the lady, and bowed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” inquired Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He done gone, miss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I done sca’ him ’way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right. That will do. You may go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He—he lef’ a messidge fo’ yo’, miss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You need not deliver it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, miss, but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must not deliver it. I will hear no message
from that person; and if he ever should dare to present
himself here again you are to treat him just as
you have to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, miss, sartinly, des as yo’ say. Doag an all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any mo’ o’ders, miss?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None. You may go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous bowed stiffly and went out, somewhat disappointed
at not having had an opportunity to tell his
bragging story in detail.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now what is it all about?” inquired Owlet as
soon as the man had left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only, dear, that a very disagreeable person, whom
I did not wish to see, tried to push himself into the
house,” Roma replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then if the person wanted to come where he was
not welcome, he was not possessed of common sense!
And, oh, dear me! How many people are not possessed
of common sense! And they make most of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>trouble in this world, too, that they do!” said Owlet
in a tone of despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ducky Darling came up to her, put her arm around
her neck, and kissed her, in silent sympathy with a
complaint she could not understand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='c007'>ANOTHER SHOCK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Roma sank into deep and troubled thought. The
appearance of Hanson in her neighborhood was annoying
and embarrassing in the extreme. He had not the
shadow of a shade of any sort of claim on her, she
knew, yet he would pretend to one, and make himself
very troublesome, now that her relatives had left her,
and she was alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>What should she do?</p>

<p class='c009'>A very little reflection convinced her that her best
and wisest course, indeed her only course, was to confide
in her venerable pastor.</p>

<p class='c009'>This she determined to do without delay, as there
was no time to be lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>She rang her hand bell, and brought Pompous once
more to her presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go,” she said, “and tell Puck to saddle a horse,
and come around here to take a letter from me to Dr.
Shaw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous bowed, and strutted off to do his errand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma sat down to her writing-desk and wrote a
note to her old friend and pastor, asking him to come
out and see her on the following morning, if convenient,
as she was in imminent need of his counsel
on a very pressing matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>When her messenger presented himself she gave
him the note, and told him to take it to the rectory
and wait for an answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the boy had gone Roma sent the children out
to play, and took up her knitting and seated herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>in her easy-chair to try to compose herself. But even
her “contemplative” knitting work failed of its usual
sedative effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day passed heavily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Late in the afternoon her messenger returned, bringing
a note from Dr. Shaw and a letter from the post
office.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma opened the note before glancing at the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was but a line from the rector, saying that he
had a marriage ceremony to perform in the parish
church at ten o’clock, but would start for Goblin Hall
immediately after its conclusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The letter was from Mr. Merritt, and also very
short; merely saying that he wrote in great haste to
catch the first mail, to warn her in time that Hanson
had turned up that morning, and might get her address
and give her trouble. “But if he should, my
dear, just turn him over to the law and telegraph for
me,” added the old lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This must have come in the mail on the same train
that brought him, and reached Goeberlin about eleven.
Truly, he lost no time between the train and my door,”
Roma said to herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>It then occurred to her to send Puck back to Goeberlin
with a telegram to Mr. Merritt, summoning him
to her aid. But upon reflection she decided to wait
until after she should have talked with Dr. Shaw.
Early in the evening she sent the little black child
home to its mother, and sent Owlet off to bed, and
soon after laid her own head on her sleepless pillow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very early the next morning she arose, dressed,
and went out to get a breath of the fine, fresh spring
air.</p>

<p class='c009'>She found Owlet, who always rose with the birds
and the chickens, already up and dressed, and sitting
on the steps of the porch, with her pup at her feet,
and with her tiny workbasket beside her, filled with
scraps of brilliant satin and velvet and spools of
bright sewing silk, busy at work on the square of a
crazy quilt. Owlet never dressed dolls, never played
with or possessed one. She was a little crank on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>subject of shams of all sorts, and dolls she considered
shams. She was also a utilitarian, “pure and
simple.” She loved to do all useful work. The crazy
quilt took her fancy wonderfully. She highly approved
of it, for she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It uses up all the tiny little scrappy scraps that
you could not do anything else with, and you don’t
have to waste the least mite in cutting, but make the
scraps fit just as they are. Oh, it is the best thing
ever thought of, and why they should call it a crazy
quilt the Lord only knows, when it is the most sensible
sort of a quilt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So here she sat this morning, busy with her square,
fitting “jags and tags and other bright fags” into
a bewildering confusion of patchwork.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you get on, Owlet?” inquired Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, splendid! I have nearly used up all the scraps
I have got.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what will you do when you get through?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, then I mean to put my squares away until I
can get more scraps, and take hold and help Hera
to make her rag carpet,” said the child, laying her
brilliant wilderness down on her lap and smoothing
it out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rag carpet?” echoed Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I’ll tell you all about it. You gather up all
the old rags you can find, and wash them clean, and
dry them dry, and then you cut ’em into strips and
sew the strips together and wind ’em into big balls,
and when you have got enough you put it in a loom
and weave it into a carpet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. It isn’t such a pretty work as the sensible
quilt, but is so saving and so useful. I can’t weave,
but I certainly can cut strips and sew ’em together,
and wind ’em up into balls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ducky is nearly as old as you are. Do you try to
teach her to sew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. It’s no use. You can’t do it. She can’t learn.
Ducky Darling is as sweet as sugar, but—I’m afraid—she
is not possessed of common sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Roma was surprised into a laugh at the hesitation,
the regret and the solemnity expressed in Owlet’s
words and looks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here she comes now, poor little thing, playing on
the musical box I gave her. That’s all she can do,
and that’s only turning a little crank, you know,”
added Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ducky Darling waddled up to them, radiant with
life and joy, her eyes shining like great stars from
the night of her dark face. She was playing on her
toy music box with the greatest delight, though the
instrument, being out of repair ever since it had been
in her possession, could furnish no particular tune,
but mixed up rollicking “Yankee Doodle” with dirgelike
“Araby’s Daughter” in the most eccentric manner.
No less on that account was Ducky Darling
delighted with her toy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma sat down on the steps and took the little
black child on her lap and began to talk to her, to
draw her out.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there was nothing in her to bring out but tenderness,
love, devotion. She had no thoughts on any,
even the simplest, subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>The breakfast bell rang.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you had your breakfast, Dorcas?” inquired
Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Es,” said the child, still turning her music box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did you have for breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“B’ead an’ m’ik an’ ’lasses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A very good breakfast. Now you sit here and
play your organ until we get ours,” said Miss Fronde,
lifting the child from her lap and seating her on the
steps.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet gathered up her work and rose, and the two
went into the house and sat down to the table in the
pleasant room, where four windows opened, two upon
the old garden and two upon the woods, whence came
in the fresh morning air, laden with the perfume of
flowers and the songs of birds.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the meal was over Roma said to Owlet:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will go to our lessons at once, and get them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>through before Dr. Shaw comes. I expect him about
noon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So little Ducky Darling was called in, and the three
went into the sitting-room, where Miss Fronde seated
herself in her favorite rocker, with her knitting in
her hand, and the two children sat side by side on
little chairs that had been hunted out of the lumber
room in the attic and brought down for their use.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet had a primary geography in her hand and
Ducky Darling an A B C card between her fingers
and her teeth, imbibing letters after her own fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quiet reigned in the little circle. Roma felt strangely
tranquilized; Owlet was pleased with her study of
continents and oceans; and Ducky Darling was delighted
only to be allowed to sit beside the little playmate
she loved so well, and who seemed to her like
an angel of light and beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour passed on without interruption, and then
the sound of wheels was heard rolling toward the
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That must be Dr. Shaw,” said Roma, as she left
her chair to look from her window. “And yet it cannot
be, for it is but ten o’clock, and at this hour he
is in the church, engaged in performing that marriage
ceremony of which he wrote.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then a misgiving that the visitor might be Hanson
come again, seized her. She was about to leave the
room to lock the front door, when she saw the carriage
stop, and—Lawyer Merritt get out of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a cry of delight she ran to open the door for
him in person.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. Merritt! I thank heaven you have come!
Was it an inspiration? What brought you?” she exclaimed,
seizing both his hands and dragging him into
the drawing-room just as Pompous was strutting majestically
up the hall to answer his knock.</p>

<p class='c009'>She drew a big armchair and pushed him into it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! Sit down! You must have traveled all
night. You must be tired. You shall have a cup of
coffee immediately. Pompous!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop, my dear,” said Mr. Merritt as soon as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>could get a chance to speak. “I breakfasted at the
Goeberlin House while waiting to get a carriage to
bring me here. Had to wait two hours to find one
disengaged. There was a wedding on hand, or something.
However, I utilized the time by getting a bath
and a breakfast, so now, my dear, I am quite comfortable,
and entirely at your service. You got my
letter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear friend, and I should have telegraphed
for you last night but for ‘sober second thought.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you had your telegram would have missed me.
I was on my way here before you could have got my
letter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! what inspired you to come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Intense solicitude on your account. After I had
mailed my letter I heard, by the merest accident, that
Hanson had started for this place. I determined to
follow by the next train, and here I am. I found the
fellow’s name on the hotel register at Goeberlin. Of
course he has been here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but got no admittance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The insolence of the scoundrel! What do you propose
to do, my child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sent a message yesterday to my old pastor, Dr.
Shaw, to come and advise me. I expect him here between
eleven and twelve o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is well, so far as it goes, but I am glad I
came.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I am very glad and very grateful!” fervently
exclaimed Roma. “But how did this wretch turn
up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven knows. Come back from a long cruise,
perhaps. He appeared at my office on Monday morning,
inquiring for you. He was so insolent that I
threatened to throw him out of the window, and
should have done so, too, if he had not left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Merritt, do you know that none of my friends
here know the base fraud that was perpetrated
against me by this man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose not, my dear. It was not a pleasant piece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>of news for you to tell, and no one else could have
told it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. But now that Hanson has come to this neighborhood,
and dares to come to this house and set up
a claim to me, I feel that I must tell my old friend,
Dr. Shaw, and get the benefit of his advice on the
social side of the case.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you are right, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, Mr. Merritt, can I ask another favor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything you like, Roma. I came down here to
serve you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, when Dr. Shaw comes to-day, will you tell
him the story of that felonious marriage, which has
nearly wrecked my life?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will do so, my dear. It is even much better that
I should tell him than that you should,” promptly
replied the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>This decision had scarcely been reached when the
sound of wheels was again heard on the avenue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is Dr. Shaw now, I am sure!” exclaimed
Roma, and again she anticipated the slow and solemn
movements of Pompous by flying to the front door
and opening it at the instant the old minister alighted
from his carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope there is no trouble, my dear,” said the kindly
old man, after the first greetings had passed, and she
was showing him into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear friend, there is trouble. Sit down here
in this large chair; put your feet on this hassock; give
me your hat and gloves. There is our mutual friend,
Mr. Merritt, of Washington. He will tell you all
you should know,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>The clergyman and the attorney shook hands very
cordially. They were old friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma left the room for a moment to put up the
pastor’s hat and gloves and to release the children
from their lessons and send them out to play.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she returned to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then and there, in her presence, the story of
her unequaled wrongs was told by the lawyer to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>old pastor, who listened with an amazed, horrified,
scandalized expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, this sinner is a subject for the State prison!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He deserves it,” assented the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my poor Roma! My dear child!” sighed the
old minister, taking her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma winced. She hated to be pitied, even by her
kind-hearted pastor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The only way in which the wretch can hurt me
is by his false, unscrupulous tongue. He will tell
every one who will listen to him that he married me,
while I am known to be living here as a single woman.
This will cause humiliating gossip. People always get
facts distorted in cases like this, out of the routine
of life. Questions will be asked and answered recklessly.
There will have been something irregular, if
not disreputable, in the matter. Was she married,
or not married? will be asked. To which was she
married? To whom ought she to have been married?
Such questions, relative to a woman, right or wrong,
just or unjust, reasonable or unreasonable, must always
be damaging. Curiosity investigates without
justice; thoughtlessness perverts, and malice distorts.
I must be prepared to meet all this,” concluded Roma,
with a profound sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear child,” said Dr. Shaw, “give me your authority
to tell your whole story from beginning to
end, without any concealments from your friends and
neighbors, and believe me, Roma, it will meet with
nothing but full confidence, sympathy and admiration.
Come; shall I do this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Use your own excellent judgment, dear Dr. Shaw,
and accept my heartfelt thanks. Already you have
inspired me with courage,” said Roma, brightening.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Lawyer Merritt laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The idea of any one inspiring you with courage,
my royal Amazon! You, who have displayed courage
and heroism under trials that must have daunted the
bravest,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! but, dear friend, there is one sort of trial that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>would crush me—to have the good name of my mother’s
daughter breathed upon by slander.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That must never—can never be, Roma!” exclaimed
the clergyman and the lawyer, in a breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment they were interrupted by a strange
incident.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ducky Darling rushed into the room and flung herself
face downward on the floor, with all her limbs
sprawled out, howling:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Owly! Owly! Owly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what is the matter, Dorcas?” inquired Miss
Fronde, raising the child to her feet and looking at
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little black face was all screwed up with anguish
and streaming with tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about Owlet? Where is she?” inquired the
young lady, drawing the child nearer and gazing in
her convulsed face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dorn’way! W’ite man!” sobbed the child, wildly
weeping.</p>

<p class='c009'>“White man? What white man? Stop crying, dear,
and tell me all about it,” said Roma, with increasing
anxiety, while the minister and the attorney looked
on with silent interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! w’ite man! Owly! Owly!” wildly wailed the
child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you leave Owlet? Tell me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yoad!—ta’yidge! w’ite man! Owly! Owly!” heaved
and gasped the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come and show me where you left her,” said Miss
Fronde, now seriously alarmed, as she took the hand
of the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dorcas, her little black face streaming with tears,
her breast heaving with sobs, drew the lady, followed
by the two gentlemen, toward the door, out of the
house, along the locust avenue, and through the great
gate leading to the road, which was bordered on the
opposite side by a fine piece of woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deh! deh!” she wildly wailed, pointing to a nook
under the trees, which was a favorite resort with the
children.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>There were the signs of the children’s late presence
and abrupt departure. There on the ground lay Ducky
Darling’s adored musical box, dropped and forgotten
in her wild woe. There also lay Owlet’s little workbasket,
upset, with needle case, scissors, thimble,
spools of silk and bright scraps scattered among the
weeds and wild flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the road, just in front of the spot, were traces
of carriage wheels which had stopped and turned
there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deh! deh!” still wildly wailed the child. “Deh!—w’ite
man!—ta’yidge!—Owly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma began to understand, and a sickening fear
seized her heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean,” she inquired, “that a white man
carried Owlet away in a carriage?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Es-s-s! Oh, ’es-s-s!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which way did he go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deh-h-h-h!” howled the child, pointing up the road
leading to the village.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma would not let the poor child see how much
shocked, grieved and bewildered she really was.</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned and looked in the faces of her two good
friends and supporters.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI<br> <span class='c007'>WHO ABDUCTED OWLET?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“The child has been abducted,” said Roma, turning
very pale, and closing her lips very grimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her two companions looked up in alarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By whom, in the name of heaven, do you think??”
inquired Parson Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not certain,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What shall you do?” asked Lawyer Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Order a carriage, though it will be of little or no
use, so far as the recovery of the child is concerned,
if she has been carried off by the person whom I suspect,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Roma said, her lip beginning to quiver and her
eyes to fill, despite all her firmness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whom do you suspect, my dear?” inquired the
parson, while the countenance of the lawyer expressed
the question which he did not put in words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is only one person open to suspicion,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That dandy devil, Hanson!” exclaimed Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hanson! Yes, there can be little doubt but that
he has had me under espionage for a long time past,
even while he himself was far away, and has learned,
among other facts, my adoption of and affection for
this child, and may hope to get a hold on me through
my attachment to her. Yet, really, the plan seems
so futile, the means so inadequate to the end proposed,
as to be quite unworthy of the intelligence even
of Hanson. So he may not, after all, have been the
abductor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if not Hanson, who then?” demanded Mr.
Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. But we are losing precious time. I
will go and order the carriage. Will you kindly accompany
me to the village, gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly.” “Of course; with pleasure,” responded
the parson and the lawyer in a breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the three turned toward the house—Miss
Frond leading the weeping black infant, who seemed
to have been converted into an inexhaustible fountain
of tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will take the child with us. The drive may
distract her grief,” said Roma as they walked on.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the lawn before the house they found Puck, who
had just returned from the post office with a packet
of letters and papers in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take them into the parlor, and leave them on the
table. I have no time to look at them now,” said
Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am,” replied the negro. Then, noticing
Ducky Darling: “W’y, wot de name ob sense is de
matter ’long o’ yo’, Dorky?” he inquired of the wailing
little one.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“W’ite man!—Owly!—ta’yidge!” wailed the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot? Wot she mean, young mist’ess?” politely
questioned the father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Owlet has been carried off in a carriage by some
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lor’!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no time to talk about it now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ she jus’ doted on dat w’ite chile, Dorky did.
Who could ’a’ done it?” persisted the amazed negro.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are going to see. Hurry, now, and put the
bays to the barouche, and bring it around to the door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is me or Uncle Pompous to dribe?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You. Hasten!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nebber heard ob sich a fing in all my born days!
Man to steal a w’ite chile? Wot ebber any man want
’long ob a chile wot don’t ’long to him passes me.
Trouble ’nuff wid dem we has to ’vide fo’,” muttered
Puck to himself as he ran away to do his errands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Fronde passed into the house, went upstairs,
put on her bonnet, mantle and gloves, covered Ducky
Darling’s little curly black head with one of Owlet’s
hats, and came down, leading the child, into the hall,
where she found the two gentlemen ready, and waiting
for her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The carriage was at the door. They entered it, Mr.
Merritt lifting the little darky to a seat beside her
mistress, and were soon on their way.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour’s rapid drive brought them to the village.</p>

<p class='c009'>They drew up before the Goeberlin House, where
Mr. Merritt got out to make inquiries concerning the
suspected man, who, if he stopped any time in the
little town, must have put up there, as it was the only
hotel of any sort in the place.</p>

<p class='c009'>He entered the office to interview the clerk, while
Roma remained with her companions in the carriage,
anxiously awaiting the result of the lawyer’s investigation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little darky had cried herself into a state of
collapse and quietness, with her head on Roma’s lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>In about fifteen minutes Merritt came out with a
very grave face.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Well?” anxiously exclaimed the young lady.
“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer, standing at the carriage door, made
this report:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hanson has been staying at the Goeberlin House
for the past two days. This morning he hired a
carriage from its stables, saying that he was going
some miles in the country to bring a little ward who
had been left to his guardianship, and take her with
him to the North. He was gone about two hours, and
returned to the house about an hour and a half ago,
bringing the child with him. The child was not taken
out of the carriage. She lay very still on the cushions,
and seemed to be asleep. Mr. Hanson only
stopped long enough to pay his bill and get his valise,
and then was driven rapidly off to the railway depot
to catch the 1:30 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> train for the East.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the story told by the hotel clerk, and repeated
by Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To ‘make assurance doubly sure,’ let us drive at
once to the depot and make inquiries there,” said Miss
Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer re-entered the carriage, took his seat,
and gave the order.</p>

<p class='c009'>The horses’ heads were turned, and a few minutes’
fast driving brought them to the depot.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the carriage was drawn up Mr. Merritt
got out and went to the ticket window to ask questions,
while his companions waited inside the vehicle
in anxious suspense.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a very few minutes the lawyer returned, and
standing in his former position before the carriage
door, made his second report, from the ticket clerk
and the railway porter:</p>

<p class='c009'>“A gentleman answering the description of Hanson
had come in a close carriage just before the 1:30 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>
train for Baltimore was due. He had taken tickets
and engaged a compartment for himself and a little
child, who seemed to be sick or sleeping, for he carried
her very carefully and tenderly in his arms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was all the employes of the depot could tell.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Now, you see, he must have chloroformed, or in
some other manner drugged and stupefied that unfortunate
child, in order to get off with her. He is
certainly a most prominent candidate for an election,
by a jury of his countrymen, to the penitentiary,”
said Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma was very pale and silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old parson looked from the lawyer to the lady,
but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, he has got off with the child. But we can
telegraph—we can telegraph to the police at Baltimore
to arrest him at the depot. And that will be
likely to end his career in the State prison. How a
man of his intelligence could so recklessly put himself
in the power of the law is an act of madness I cannot
understand. But I will telegraph at once,” concluded
the lawyer, turning from the carriage door to
re-enter the depot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Roma, speaking for the first time. “Do
not telegraph. He has not put himself in the power
of the law. I only wished to ascertain whether Hanson
was the man who carried off the child. Now I have
done so, I see that I cannot interfere. Let us go
home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Roma!” exclaimed the astonished lawyer,
“is it possible that you do not know that this scoundrel
has committed a felony in the abduction of your
ward, for which you can send him to the State
prison?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no; we could not convict him of any crime in
this case.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what do you mean, my dear? Why, in the
name of reason and justice, could we not convict
him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because the child he has carried off is his own,”
calmly replied Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“His?” demanded the dazed lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“His own child—the child of his deceased wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Roma!” exclaimed the lawyer in utter
amazement, while the parson opened wide his eyes
and stared in consternation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“Get in the carriage, Mr. Merritt, and I will explain
as we go along. But first tell the coachman to
take us back to the Goeberlin House. I would like
to question the man who drove this hack. I would
like to know exactly how the abduction was effected,”
Miss Fronde said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer gave the order and resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>They reached the Goeberlin House, and sent a boy
who was loitering on the sidewalk to fetch the hackman
they wanted from the stables.</p>

<p class='c009'>A young negro man answered the summons. He
came up to the carriage door, bowed, and stood at
attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma herself questioned him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He answered that he had driven the “ge’man” down
Goblin Hall road, but had stopped the carriage some
distance from the great gate, at the “ge’man’s” orders,
where the “ge’man” got out, telling him to wait. The
“ge’man” was gone about fifteen minutes, and then
came up the road from the direction of the gate, bringing
a child, who seemed to be asleep, in his arms, and
that another child—a little black child—followed, running
and screaming, until the carriage drove off and
left her behind. He drove the “ge’man” to the hotel,
where he got out to pay his bill and get his valise,
and then he drove them to the depot, where they took
the 1:30 train for Baltimore. That was all he knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma thanked the man and dismissed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now let us go home,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The order was given, and the carriage started.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now you see she must have been chloroformed
in the first instance,” said Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you say she was his own child, Roma? How
could that have been, my dear?” inquired Dr. Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear friends, Owlet is William Hanson’s own
child,” Roma replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Explain, my dear,” said Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That poor young woman, known to us as Madam
Marguerite Nouvellini, who died in my arms in Washington
a few days ago, was the abandoned wife of
William Hanson, who had married her under a false
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>name when he was but a youth and she little more
than a child. She never knew his real name. A few
months after their marriage he left her in Paris, and
went, under pretence of business, to California, from
where he wrote piteous letters from a pretended bed
of sickness—letters which grew shorter and more piteous—until
at length they prepared her to receive a
black-bordered and black-sealed letter from his invented
physician announcing his death from the fever.
To the hour of her death she never knew her decamped
husband was still living.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Roma, my dear child, are you quite sure of what
you are telling us? For the story shows the man to
be a greater sinner, if possible, than we have yet
believed him,” said Parson Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite sure, my dear doctor. I have indubitable
proof of the fact.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you know all this when you first took the
poor young woman under your protection?” inquired
Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not then, but in a very few weeks afterward.
She was a very simple, childlike creature. She put
me in possession of her short life’s story. She showed
me the picture of her husband—Guilliaume Nouvellini
she called him—who met her at a Parisian theater,
and married her there. I recognized the picture
as that of William Hanson. His sister, Rebecca Bushe,
has the counterpart of it. She showed me also some
of the letters and verses he had written to her, in
which she took the greatest pride, poor soul! I recognized
his peculiar, well-known handwriting. I was,
therefore, absolutely certain that the dead Guilliaume
Nouvellini, the husband for whom she had been
mourning for nearly five years, and the living William
Hanson, who had tried to marry me, were one and
the same man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did not tell her this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not. Of what use could the information
have been to her, poor soul? Why should I have disturbed
the last days of a dying wife by such a tale?
No, she never knew it.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Are you sure that there was a lawful marriage?”
inquired Parson Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She showed me the documentary proofs both of
her marriage and of the birth and baptism of her
child, which she carefully preserved, because, she said,
she was the granddaughter and heiress of Mrs. Arbuthnot,
of Arbuthnot, in the Highlands of Scotland,
whom, however, she had never once seen, for the reason
that the stern old lady, who was of ancient family,
and of the Church of Scotland, and prejudiced both
by birth and by creed against the stage, had discarded
her only child, Marguerite’s mother, for marrying an
actor. Marguerite, however, cherished hopes that,
now the old lady was nearly eighty, she might, before
death, relent toward her descendants and seek
them out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think it highly probable she would,” said
Lawyer Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No professing Christian, as she is reported to be,
dare go before the Divine Judge with malice in her
heart,” added Parson Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you these documents, my dear?” inquired the
lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly; very carefully put away,” replied Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, of course, you have written to the Scotch
lady?” added Dr. Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course. Immediately after the death of
that poor young creature I wrote to Mrs. Arbuthnot,
giving her full particulars of her granddaughter and
the condition in which her infant great-grandchild was
left. I said nothing of William Hanson. There has
not yet been time to receive an answer to my letter,”
concluded Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think, my dear, that Hanson knows the
child he has carried off to be his own daughter?” inquired
Dr. Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not a doubt of it. Else he would not have
dared to take her. I suppose he has had me under
espionage for a long time, and even during his long
disappearance. I think, of course, that he knows the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>parentage of my adopted pet as well as he knows my
affection for her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear Roma, are you quite sure that you
have not been deceived in this matter? Even that
your poor protégée was not herself deceived?” inquired
Lawyer Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite sure. I can show you documents and correspondence
that will place the matter beyond question,
even of a Washington lawyer. But here we are at
home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The carriage drew up before the entrance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Puck got down from his box and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two gentlemen alighted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Ducky Darling had cried herself to sleep, sitting
on the floor of the carriage, with her head on
Roma’s lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>She lifted her very tenderly, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, Puck, take little Dorcas very carefully, so as
not to wake her, and carry her to her mother. Never
mind the horses for the present. You know they will
stand until you return.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man obeyed under protest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Deed, young mist’ess, yo’ sp’ils dis young ’un!
’Deed yo’ does. ’Taine no good treatin’ ob her jus’
like she was a w’ite chile! ’Deed it ain’t! ’Ca’se yo’
see yo’ can’t keep it up, yo’ know, w’en she gets ol’er,”
he said, as he carried off his little burden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man is in the right, my dear,” said Dr. Shaw
as he gave his hand to Roma to help her from the
carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Fronde threw off her bonnet, mantle and gloves
in the hall, where the gentlemen also left their hats,
for they were to stay and dine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three entered the sitting-room and found seats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we have returned from a fruitless errand,”
said Mr. Merritt, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not quite, since we know for a certainty that it
was the father who carried off the child; and surely
no father, not even Hanson, could fail to be kind to
his own and only child—the child of his youth and
love, the motherless child of his young, deserted, dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>wife,” said Miss Fronde, trying to console herself for
the loss of her protégée, “and at least we have got rid
of Hanson,” she added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only for the present, I fear. He is a very persistent
wretch,” said Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, he will come again, and that brings me to
what I intended to say to you, my dear Roma, as soon
as I knew that you had returned to live here alone,
and before I had heard the sad story you told me this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Speak your mind, dear Dr. Shaw. I shall be grateful
for your counsel. It was to seek it, you know,
that I begged your presence here this morning,” Roma
replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, my dear girl, this is what I wished to say
to you—that since you declined to accompany your
relatives abroad, and have decided to live here, in this
remote manor house, you should not live alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not. I have faithful servants and powerful
dogs. I am perfectly safe here,” said Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In person, yes, perhaps. But that is not the question,
my dear. You will understand me when I say
that you should have some elderly, respectable woman—some
lady, in fact—to live with you as your chaperon
and companion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” exclaimed Miss Fronde. “Should I? Is that
necessary?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Absolutely necessary, in my opinion, Roma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cannot a woman, nearly twenty-three years of age,
who is intrusted with the management of a large estate
and the expenditure of a princely revenue, be
also trusted with the care of herself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in the opinion of the world, my dear Roma.
For the world rates—and rightly rates—a woman’s
fair reputation far above land or money,” gravely replied
the old minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma’s fair face flushed crimson to the edges of her
blond hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” she said, somewhat indignantly, “I think the
world places a very low and evil estimate on woman
when it presumes to infer that because she is neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>married, widowed nor aged, she cannot, therefore, be
trusted to preserve her own good name and fair fame.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps so, my child,” temperately replied the old
rector, “but we are not the autocrats of society; public
opinion is, and it is generally right; so that in every
instance in which it does not conflict with conscience
we should submit to its laws.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, Dr. Shaw. I will advertise for an elderly
lady as chaperon, though I do shrink from having
the constant companionship of a perfect stranger,”
said Roma submissively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, child, it is a risk, I know; for even in the
most respectable woman, most highly recommended,
you may chance to find an uncongenial companion, or
you may find a ‘perfect treasure.’ But you can always
get rid of one who does not suit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no,” said Roma, “that is just what I could
never do. Once having taken a ‘poor lady,’ as such
a person must be, into the house, I should not like to
send her away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Mr. Merritt, breaking into the tête-à-tête
for the first time, “Roma would keep her for the term
of her natural life, however disagreeable she might
be—an incubus, an old man of the sea. So you must
be very careful, my dear girl, in your selection of a
chaperon—as careful as a man should be in the choosing
of a wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A summons to dinner broke up the conference.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII<br> <span class='c007'>ROMA’S DECISION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fronde’s guests left Goblin Hall very soon
after dinner, the lawyer to go back to his chambers
in Washington, the minister to return to his parsonage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both, in taking leave of her, had placed themselves
entirely at her service, imploring her to notify them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>by message or telegram whenever she might want
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma thanked her old friends, and promised all they
wished.</p>

<p class='c009'>After their departure she sat quite alone in the
small, dark-wainscoted parlor. The sun had gone down
behind a bank of clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now coming on to rain, and the air was cold
for April.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pompous came in and lighted the wax candles at
each end of the mantelpiece and the moderator lamp
on the round center table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, without orders, he brought in a basketful of
resinous pine cones and kindled a bright fire on the
hearth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma scarcely noticed what he was doing until the
sudden blaze in the fireplace made her look up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take de chill offen de ’a’, young mist’ess. Moughty
onsartain dese Ap’il days an’ nights—moughty. Yere
dis mornin’ so hot in de sun you’d ’a’ sought it mought
be July ’stead ob Ap’il; now so col’ an’ damp yo’
mought sink it was Janiwery. Now I gwine fetch two
or free cedar logs an’ lay on top o’ dese yere, an’ it
will keep yo’ a sweet, lively little fire all de ebenin’,”
said the negro as he turned to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Pontius,” replied Roma, leaving her
seat, in her restlessness, and beginning to walk up
and down the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few minutes the negro returned, laid the cedar
logs across the andirons, clapped his hands gently
over the hearth, to shake them free of fibers of bark,
and then stood as if he had something to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma, pacing up and down the floor, scarcely noticed
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mons’ous sorry to year wot happen’d ob, youn’
mist’ess. Nebber yeared nuftin ’t all ’bout it till I
come f’om de mill dis arternoon. Mons’ous sorry I
didn’ set Tige on dat lowlife w’ite trash yes’day. Mons’ous
sorry. Ef ebber he do sho’ his lowlife w’ite face
onto dis plantation ag’in I gwine set Tige on him, fo’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>sho! I is, ef I’s got to hang fo’ it. I is, indeed. Trufe,
fo’ a fac’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think he will come again,” said Miss
Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He better not. ’Deed, he better not. Not ef he
knows wot’s good fo’ his healf, he hadn’t. But, say,
young mist’ess, can’t yo’ have dat w’ite herrin’ hung
fo’ stealing dat chile?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hardly, Pontius.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All yight, den. I’ll be hung fo’ him ef he ebber
sho’ his face yere ag’in. It’s de trufe, fo’ a fac’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Fronde made no comment. She scarcely heard
the monologue of the man, who continued to talk in
the same strain, repeating himself over and over
again, as is the manner of his kind, until, receiving
no encouragement to stand and talk, he strutted out
of the room in his usual ponderous fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma came and threw herself down in the easy-chair
beside the table, on which stood the moderator
lamp. By its light she saw the packet of letters and
papers that had been brought from the Goeberlin post
office by Puck in the afternoon, and, in the exciting
events of the time, had been forgotten until this moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were three letters—all of them foreign—one
from Mrs. Gray, one from Abbot Elde, and one from
Tim Toomie.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not necessary to go into this correspondence in
detail, but only to glance at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tim Toomie’s letter—“the last shall be first”—was
the only one with which he had ever honored Miss
Fronde. He wrote to implore her to go over to Toomie’s
Farm and see his people and tell him all about
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For,” he wrote, “they are not used to letter writing,
and their letters are not satisfactory. They give
me only the baldest outlines of news, as ‘All are well
here,’ or ‘Your granny has got a cold in her head,’ or
‘The red cow has got a calf,’ or something like that,
and I am hungry and thirsty for news from home, my
dear Miss Fronde.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“I will take a day and go over to see the Toomies,
and write the little fellow a long letter, with a full
account of them,” Roma said to herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Gray’s and Abbot Elde’s letters still rang the
changes on the delights of their foreign home and
their desire to have Roma with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come over,” wrote Mrs. Gray, “with Dr. Shaw. He
has promised to make us a visit in August and September.
Persuade him to anticipate the time and to
escort you over in May.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?” said Roma to herself, as she folded up
her aunt’s letter. “Why not, indeed? I have nothing
to keep me here now. The court has annulled the
fraudulent marriage; Will Harcourt has been found,
only to be more completely lost to me than ever; my
poor little adopted child has been wrested from me
by her own father, from whom I cannot recover her,
except at a price for which I would not purchase my
own soul, if it were about to be lost. Why not go to
Scotland? But not before I settle up some business
here. I will consult Dr. Shaw. I cannot ask him to
come to me again so soon, but I shall see him at
church on Sunday and make an appointment with him
for next week. Yes, that is the best I can do,” concluded
Roma, as she arose and resumed her walk up
and down the floor. She walked until she was suddenly
interrupted by the entrance of Ceres, who wanted
to know if Miss Fronde would have a fire lighted
in her bedroom, as the night was so cold and wet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma declined the fire, but said that as it was late
she would retire, which she immediately did.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rain ceased to fall during the night, and the
next morning the weather was fair and mild.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately after breakfast Roma ordered her carriage,
and drove over to Toomie’s Farm to see the
family there. She found them all well, and doing well.
She did not tell them of their Tim’s complaining letter
to herself, lest it should give them pain, but she
found out that she had no occasion to do so, as they
had had a letter from him by the same mail which
brought hers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Roma accepted their invitation to spend the day,
by doing which she knew that she would be able to
write a longer and fuller account to the absent son.</p>

<p class='c009'>She found—what, indeed, she had known before—that
they were all very proud and fond of Tim.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma returned home by sunset, and after tea spent
the evening in writing a very long letter to Mr. Toomie
and two very short ones to Mrs. Gray and Abbot
Elde.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she had finished and sealed these epistles she
rang the bell, and gave them to Puck, to be taken
to the post office early in the morning. Then she went
to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the remainder of the week her neighbors
began to call on her, to welcome her back to her home.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had all heard from Dr. Shaw of the terrible
wrong that had been attempted against her in the
felonious marriage, and tendered their hearty congratulations
on her escape from danger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our young men threaten to lynch him,” said Dr.
Keech, “and although at my age, and with my profession,
which is to save life and not to destroy it, I
would not assist at such a ceremony, neither would I
utter a word or lift a finger to prevent it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma was certainly comforted by the hearty sympathy
of her neighbors, though she did wish that it
had been silent and not clamorous.</p>

<p class='c009'>At church, the next Sunday, she saw Dr. Shaw again
and begged him to call on her as early in the week
as he conveniently could do so, as she wished to consult
him again. He promised to come on the next
morning, adding that Monday was always his least
busy day.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, early on the next morning, the good minister
made his appearance at Goblin Hall. It was one of
the fine days of the fitful April weather—warm
enough for June. Roma was seated on the front piazza,
with Ducky Darling at her feet, playing on the
broken musical box.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the parson rode up, dismounted, and tied his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>horse, Roma arose to meet him, shook hands with him
cordially, and invited him into the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my child, I will sit here, if you please. It is
cooler. It is very pleasant out here,” he said, sinking
into one of the Quaker chairs, drawing his handkerchief
from his pocket and wiping his forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma took his broad-brimmed felt hat into the hall
and hung it up. Ceres, who was dusting the dining-room,
she told to make a pitcher of iced lemonade and
bring it out.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she returned to the piazza she called Puck
from the flower bed he was weeding and told him to
take the doctor’s horse to the stable and attend to
him there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any fresh disturbance from that man, my child?
For if there is, you know we will have to bind him
over to keep the peace,” said Dr. Shaw, as soon as
Roma had taken her seat beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, thank heaven! But I have received letters
from my relatives in Delfcome, urging me to
come to them. I think of going; that is all. No, it is
not all, either, by the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You think of going? How soon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as soon as I get through some work I have
set myself to do, by which time I hope you will be
ready to take care of me on the voyage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I?—oh, my dear child!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They expect you for August and September.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A dream! a dream, my dear! I cannot leave my
flock without a shepherd.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you shall not, dear Dr. Shaw. Hear me, dear
pastor. I am the stewardess of more wealth than I
know how to manage. I need your wisdom to direct
and assist me in its distribution. For that reason I
begged your company here this morning,” Roma said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is your idea, my child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear pastor, my second and well beloved
father, I hope you will not be offended with your child,
for, first of all, I wish to employ an assistant to relieve
you of some of the arduous work of the parish,”
Roma said, almost timidly, for there were some occasions—like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>this, for instance—when our regal Amazon
was timid. She was fearful of seeming to patronize
the venerable man who had all her reverence
and affection.</p>

<p class='c009'>He understood her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your thought is kind, my child, and I thank you.
Have you any special person in view?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no one whatever. I wish you to find some
proper man, and employ him in your own name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will think it over, my child. Yes, such an assistant
would be a very great relief to me, at my age,
though that circumstance, perhaps, ought not to be
considered in the question.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not see why it should not be. I think it is
the first and most important circumstance to be considered
in the question,” Roma answered warmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, my child. I know you think so, and that
is just where your human affections and partialities
come into the way to obscure your clear view of duty
and responsibility. Now, let me ask you—is there not
some other way, in fact, are there not many other
ways, in which your means could be employed with
better advantage to the poor and suffering of this
world?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know that there are. You are wearing
yourself out in the work of this parish, and you should
be relieved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my child, it is the duty of every servant of
God to ‘spend and be spent’ in His service.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Roma thoughtfully, “and that your services
may be the longer continued to your Lord and
your people you must have an assistant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my child, there are more ways——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, and there are more means,” said Roma. Then
she broke forth, with sudden energy: “So much more
means! Oh, Dr. Shaw, you don’t know how responsible
I feel for all the wealth I have inherited. I
hardly can think it is mine—that I have any right
to it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet it is all your own, by every moral and legal
right.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“What have I ever done to earn it, to win it, or
to deserve it? Nothing. My father left me, his only
child, this plantation. But the negroes made it what
it is, not I. And the negroes have a heavy claim on
me. But how is the best way to meet that claim?
I shall want your wisdom to direct me. Then—as if
this was not enough for one woman—my Uncle Guyon
died, widowed and childless, and left me the Isle of
Storms. What had I ever done to earn or win that
fine sanitary sea home? Nothing whatever; and I
have no right to keep it all to myself. Once, indeed,
I thought of it as a summer resort for my friends
and myself only, but that was the inspiration of pride
and selflove. My friends were of that favored class
who can choose their own summer homes among the
mountains, or by the seashore, or wherever they
please. The Isle of Storms was not given me for my
own selfish pleasure, but for the best uses to humanity
to which it can be put—perhaps as a sanatorium for
destitute invalids and children. And then, again, as
if this Goeberlin plantation and the Isle of Storms
were not already much too much for one woman, my
Uncle Thomas dies unmarried, and leaves me the silver
mine in Colorado. He discovered the mine, not I.
It has proved a source of almost fabulous wealth.
But what have I done to earn, to win, or to deserve
all that? Nothing whatever. So I know that all this
is not mine, for my own selfish pride, but that it is
intrusted to me as a steward of the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me, dear child, how do you propose to discharge
the duties of your stewardship? What are
your ideas?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are nebulous yet. I want your help to form
them. I know there are things that I must do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And these?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First, get an assistant for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The aged rector bent his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Secondly, build a school here for the free education
of the colored people who have—they or their
forefathers—tilled the soil for near two centuries.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes! yes! yes!” assented the minister.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Thirdly, convert the Isle of Storms into a free
sanatorium for destitute invalids and children, and
to devote some share of my California uncle’s wealth
to the necessary expenses. So far, all is clear; beyond
this you will kindly direct me, Dr. Shaw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My child, if you set these good works going within
the next year, you will have your hands as full as
they can hold. Afterward we will talk of other enterprises.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you will aid me with your counsel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Assuredly I shall endeavor to do so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, immediately, will you seek out an assistant
for yourself? Your wide acquaintance with the
young clergy of our church will afford you facilities
for suiting your parish. After you shall have secured
your co-laborer, and I shall have placed the material
and financial part of the school and the sanatorium
in the hands of Mr. Merritt, we will go to Europe, and
make that promised visit to our friends in Delfcome,
this you will kindly direct me, Dr. Shaw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It strikes me as Utopian, my child. At the age
of seventy-five, after fifty years in the pulpit, to have
my first long holiday, my first visit to Europe—a pleasure
I never permitted myself to dream of. But I
thank heaven, my dear, that the old man has still
health and strength enough left for the voyage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after this the rector took leave, as he had to
make a sick call seven miles on the other side of
Goeberlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Fronde went in the house and wrote a long
letter to her lawyer, describing her plans, and asking
him if he could become her agent in carrying them
into execution—making contracts, engaging officers,
and so forth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The capricious days of April passed, and the delightful
days of May came, but nothing was heard
from Hanson or the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, one morning, Puck brought her a letter from
the post office, bearing the postmark of New York,
but having no proof of the writer, for it was imprinted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>by a typewriter, both as to the superscription and
contents.</p>

<p class='c009'>Guessing whom it came from, and what it treated
of, Miss Fronde anxiously opened it, and read:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The child is breaking her heart, is ill, is dying, and
will die unless she is restored to you. But you cannot
have her, even to save her life, unless you take
me also, for I also am in almost as bad a plight. I
am desperate, for never man loved woman as I love
you, nor ever did; or dared as much for her as I have
done and dared, and will do and dare for you. Only
give me an opportunity to plead my cause. Write and
tell me when and where you will see me. Direct your
letter to A B Y Z, General Post Office, New York.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Roma’s first emotion on reading this letter was one
of alarm and pity for the child; but these were soon
swallowed up in burning indignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>She studied the letter—analyzed it. How meanly
cautious it was to avoid giving her any advantage
over the writer! If he had stolen a child that was
not his own he could not have been more guarded
in his endeavor to profit by his theft without compromising
his own safety from the law. He had written
with a typewriter, he had given no address, signed
no name, mentioned no name in the body of the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why,” she asked herself, “had the man been so
cowardly cautious in communicating with her if he
knew that the child he had carried off was his own?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, for the first time, Roma felt a doubt as to
whether he did know the child to be his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps,” she reflected, “he does not know, or
even suspect the truth. Perhaps he thinks that he
has put himself in the power of the law, and therefore,
even when trying to blackmail me, he is cautious
not to let me hold any positive proof of his identity
or address, and so writes with a typewriter, and
neither dates nor signs his letter, but requires an
answer to be addressed to initials at the general post
office. I shall not answer the letter at all, even to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>refuse its terms. I will never suffer myself to be
either persuaded or provoked into answering such impertinence.
As to my darling little girl—yes, I could
almost break my heart for her, but I will not, and
neither will she—the wise little woman—break hers
for me. Owlet is ‘possessed of common sense,’ to use
her own quaint phrase. Besides, I do not believe one
word about her being ‘ill, dying, and sure to die unless
restored to me.’ Above all, more than all, she is
a child in the safe hands of the Lord, and, living or
dying, she cannot be lost out of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma took up the letter again, to tear it into fragments;
but on second thought she determined to keep
it, and show it to her two venerable friends and supporters—Parson
Shaw and Lawyer Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>About once a week the old minister came to see
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first time he came, after the receipt of the typewritten
letter, Roma drew it from her pocket and put
it in his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>She watched him until he had read it through and
returned it to her, and then she asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, the fellow is a cowardly cur—Heaven forgive
me for saying it! Think no more of the man or his
dastardly letter. As for the child, you must leave her
to the Lord. You can do nothing in the case that
would not do harm. I have good news for you, Roma,”
said the rector, with a beaming smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! yes? Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have secured an assistant—Paul Stone, a young
graduate of the Theological College at Alexandria,
who has just been ordained—a fervent young Christian,
who is very happy in the prospect of going to
hard work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very happy in the prospect of your getting
some rest,” replied Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there was a crisis at hand that must modify
all their plans. It was a crisis that no one dreamed
of.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII<br> <span class='c007'>CATCHING A TARTAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After Hanson had carried off Owlet in the manner
so incoherently announced by Ducky Darling, and
more intelligibly related by the hack driver and the
railway officials; after he had got her quietly and
safely bestowed in the snug compartment he had engaged
in the Pullman car, and the train had started,
he felt quite satisfied with his work. So far it seemed
a complete success.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet lay on the short sofa opposite to him, sleeping
under the influence of the chloroform he had administered
to her at the instant of first seizing her.
She was very quiet, almost too quiet, he at length began
to fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not wish to run any risks.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stooped over her and looked into her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very placid; her eyes were closed, her lips
slightly apart, her cheeks faintly flushed. She was
breathing easily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll do,” he said, and sank back into his seat.
He drew a newspaper from his pocket, unfolded it,
and began to read. He had read half way down the
first sporting news column, and was deeply absorbed
in his subject, when he was suddenly startled by a
voice peremptorily demanding:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He actually sprang as he looked up from his paper
to see Owlet sitting bolt upright on her sofa, regarding
him with great solemn eyes, fearless and critical.
He was really thrown off his mental balance for a
moment. He had not expected to be brought to book
by such a question from such a child. But then he
did not know Owlet. He hesitated, and then, pursing
up his lips, and opening his eyes very wide, he answered
solemnly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am the Great Mogul.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“I don’t believe it,” Owlet replied, without a change
of countenance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am also the Khan of Tartary,” he continued, gathering
his brows together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are no such thing,” said Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Likewise the Tycoon of Japan,” he concluded, in
a deep voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are telling stories! And if you tell stories
you will go down into the dark, dark world, where
there is no sun and it is always night, and no moon
nor stars, and no grass nor trees, nor even water. Oh!
you better look out, and tell me the truth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, little monkey, I am your legal guardian,
if you understand what that is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her look of grave reproof now changed to one of
contempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe you are possessed of common
sense,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” he exclaimed, with a laugh. “Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You cannot be, to tell me such a tale as that, and
think I will believe you. Yes, and I know who you
are, now I look at you good,” she added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who am I, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are the man who came to the lady’s house
yesterday and made yourself a nuisance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A nuisance, did I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, a horrid one. Oh, I saw you before Lady
did. I saw you coming up the walk to the house.
When Lady saw you she took me and Ducky in the
house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! she did?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, she did that; and she was in the right of it,
too, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why was she in the right of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because she knowed you, and knowed you was not
possessed of common sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c009'> “Yes. And she knowed you’d do something bad, I
reckon. Yes. And now I do remember all about it.
I do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Yes, I do that. You came up to where me and
my Ducky Darling was sitting under the trees by the
roadside, and I was piecing my sensible quilt, and she
was playing on her music box, and you killed me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Killed you!” exclaimed the young man in amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you did. And you need not stretch out great
big eyes at me, as if it wasn’t true, neither, for you
did. You did kill me stone dead, all in a minute, before
I could holler. I did hear Ducky Darling holler,
and then I went stone dead, and so near heaven that
I did hear the angels playing on cymbals through my
whole head. And then I knowed nothing till I come
to life this minute, right here,” Owlet said, quite
simply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, don’t you know that you are talking the
beastliest nonsense that ever was heard? If anybody
had killed you stone dead how could you come to life
again? Tell me that,” Hanson said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it sounds like nonsense,” Owlet frankly
admitted, “and if anybody had told me such a strange
thing, and wanted me to believe it, why, you know,
I should have told them they were not possessed of
common sense. But for all that, I know it is the
truth. And if anybody but you had called it nonsense
I should not have blamed them; but you know it is
the truth. You did kill me stone dead—dead! dead!
dead!—dead as a doornail!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, how the devil did you contrive to come
to life again?” laughed Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t the devil, and I didn’t contrive nothing;
and I don’t know, unless maybe I didn’t get quite
loose out of my body, for you know I only heard the
angels playing on the cymbals. I did not go among
them; and maybe the shaking of the train shook me
down again into my body, and so I come to life. But
I don’t know. It makes my head ache to think,” said
the child, putting both hands up to her forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then don’t think. It won’t pay,” Hanson advised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must,” said Owlet. “There ain’t nobody else here
to think for me. And now, then,” she exclaimed, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>sudden energy, dropping her hands and fixing him
with her eyes, “what do you mean by it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mean by what, monkey?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By killing me and carrying me off?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never hurt a hair of your head.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know you didn’t hurt me, but you killed me as
dead as Jubious Cedar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t kill you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, never mind, I come to life again, anyhow.
But what did you bring me here for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you before. I am your legal guardian, and
I have to take care of you,” said Hanson, smiling on
the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you are going it! Ain’t you afraid of the
dark world?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pooh! pooh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not my guardian! Lady is my guardian,
and you shall not take care of me; and the next place
the cars stop at I mean to get out and go home to
Lady. I know she is fretting after me now, and Ducky
Darling is crying her eyes out, too. Oh, yes, I must
get out at the very next place and go home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But suppose I cannot let you go?” inquired Hanson,
partly amused and partly annoyed by the child’s
persistence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d just like to see you try to stop me,” said Owlet,
turning her head on one side and looking at him out
of the corner of her eye in the most mocking manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what would you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d raise such a row they would think the train
was on fire—I’d scream and scream and scream, until
everybody would run to see what was the matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then what would you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would tell them all about it, and I would beg
somebody to take me home to Lady, and tell them how
much Ducky Darling would love them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who is Ducky Darling?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she is the sweetest thing you ever did see!
My sweet, lovely, dear Ducky Darling!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, the little black monkey that yelled so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>when——” Hanson began, but stopped. He did not
wish to admit too much to this uncanny child.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Owlet took up the thread he dropped, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, she was the one who screamed so when you
killed me right before her eyes. I should think she
might. I heard her just as I went dead and heard
the cymbals.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson said no more just then. He was thinking
intently.</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew that they were approaching a station,
where the train would stop fifteen minutes for refreshments,
and where this uncanny elf would certainly
give him trouble unless he could circumvent her in
some way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far is the next place where the cars stop?”
Owlet suddenly asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About ten miles; but, my child, if we get off there
we shall have to sit up all night at the station, for
there is no train coming for Goeberlin that will stop
there till to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I would not mind sitting up all night to
get back to Lady in the morning,” said Owlet eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but by going on a little further, and stopping
at the second station, we can get a down train in a
few minutes afterward, and get back to Goeberlin
by nine o’clock, and to Lady by ten o’clock. Wouldn’t
that be better?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far is the second place we stop at off from
here?” cautiously inquired Owlet before committing
herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, only about fifteen miles. We shall soon get
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you’ll take me out and take me back home by
the next train that passes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you don’t, you know, I’ll raise a row, and then
how will you feel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How, indeed! But I assure you, on the honor of
a gentleman, if, when we reach the second station you
wish to get out, I will take you out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! We are coming to the first place now!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Owlet exclaimed as the steam whistle shrieked its
warning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, here we are,” Hanson said as the train drew
near the station.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I wish we could get out here and get home!”
Owlet said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we could not get back from here to-night, as
I told you. But a few miles off we can get out and
take the down train.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And will you—oh, will you take me back to my
own Lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have sworn it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sorry you killed me and brought me
here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I did not kill you, little one. I would not have
hurt you for the whole world. Now look straight in
my face and tell me if you don’t believe me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W-e-l-l,” drawled Owlet, hesitatingly, “I may believe
you didn’t intend to do it, but you did do it, all
the same, and what you did it for the Lord only knows—I
don’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the train stopped, and people began to leave
their seats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are they going out for?” inquired Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To get something to eat. Shall I go and fetch you
some cake and some sweet wine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, do! I am awful hungry! My stomach’s
gone to my backbone. I’m as hollow as—as anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson went out and crossed to the refreshment
room, and soon returned with a paper bag of cakes
and a glass of sweet wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here,” he said, “drink the wine first, because I
must take the glass back to the room. You can eat
your cake while I am getting something for myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” said Owlet. “Don’t let me keep you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson returned to the refreshment room, made
as good a meal as he could under the circumstances,
and came back to his seat just an instant before the
train started.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet had finished her lunch, and, being a tidy little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>old party, she had gathered up the crumbs, put them
in the paper bag, and thrown them out of the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you feel?” inquired Hanson, looking at
her attentively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So good,” murmured Owlet, raising her heavy eyelids
for an instant and then letting them fall over
the great, somber eyes as she sank back in her corner
with a sigh of profound satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next moment she was fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was low in the west, and as their compartment
was at the back of the car the level rays
struck in through the window and shone upon the
child’s head, seeming to kindle sparks in her golden
brown hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train was rushing eastward with fearful speed,
but the motion only seemed to deepen the sleeper’s
slumber.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson lifted her from the corner and laid her on
the sofa, arranged her comfortably, covered her, and
tucked her in, and then drew down the blind to shade
her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will give no more trouble to-night,” he said
as he sat back in his seat and lighted a cigar, for it
was now too dark to read with the curtains drawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun set, and the porter came in to light the
lamp. The flash failed to wake the sleeping child;
yet, as a precaution, Hanson drew out his pocket handkerchief
and spread it over her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he took his newspaper and resumed his reading.</p>

<p class='c009'>The porter left the compartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sleeper slept on, and on, and on, through every
stoppage and every start of the train, until it reached
Philadelphia and ran into the lighted station.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was so still that Hanson grew uneasy again,
feeling that he was playing a dangerous game with
this child, that might affect his life as well as her
own. He felt her pulse, but found it perfectly normal.
He lifted and turned her over, with her face away
from the light. She drew a deep sigh of relief, as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>refreshed by the change of position, and then sank
into still deeper slumber.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson left the train and went into the restaurant,
where he made a very satisfactory, if rather late,
dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took his seat in his compartment just as the
train was about to start.</p>

<p class='c009'>The child seemed sleeping well.</p>

<p class='c009'>He lighted another cigar and smoked it out. Then
he composed himself for a doze, while the train sped
on from Philadelphia to New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was half-past ten o’clock when the train ran
into the depot at Jersey City.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson lifted the sleeping child in his arms, arranged
her dress, put on her hat, and laid her head
over his shoulders, saying to himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, I wonder what my yachting and sporting
friends would think if they could see me here playing
nursemaid to a young child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He laughed at the conceit as he stepped off the
train and passed along the platform, mingling with
the crowd hurrying to the ferryboat. He hurried
onto the boat and into the saloon, where he found
a seat in the most shady part of a well-lighted place.
He sat down, laid the child across his knees and
looked with some uneasiness into her sleeping face,
when, to his dismay, she opened her great, solemn,
brown eyes and looked at him. But there was no
“speculation” in her gaze, and, with a weary sigh, she
closed her eyes again and relapsed into slumber.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the crowd of passengers had all found seats
and leisure to look about them, several people, mostly
women, noticed the young man with the sleeping
child on his knees, a rather unusual sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at that young father with his child on his
lap. See how tender he is of her, how careful not
to wake her,” said one woman to another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but where is the mother? There doesn’t
seem to be anybody with him,” said her companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh,” replied the first speaker, lowering her voice,
“don’t you see, the poor young fellow is in black?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“That’s nothing. So many men wear black. It is
so becoming, you know,” said the second speaker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but the child is in black, too. Little girls
don’t wear black frocks unless they are in mourning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes. I see. That’s so. Poor things. I’m
sorry for both.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson overheard the whole conversation between
the two women, their penetrating whispers rather
more distinctly than their normal tones. And he
smiled at their inferences. Yet he was not very easy
in his mind, either. He was very much in dread of
meeting some acquaintance, especially some young
sporting man, who, recognizing him, and finding him
in his present occupation, after so mysterious a disappearance
and so long an absence, might embarrass
him with questions or vex him with “chaff.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A little later that was just what happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ferryboat touched the pier at the foot of Cortlandt
Street, and some people came on board to meet
friends who were arriving by it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson recognized a few of his acquaintances
among them, but, fortunately, they all seemed too
much engaged in searching out and welcoming friends
whom they had come to meet, to take any notice of
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Carrying the child in his arms, Hanson left the boat
with the crowd and stood in the midst of another
crowd—a vociferous crowd of hackmen and hotel
drummers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Holding the child in one arm, with her head on his
shoulder, he beckoned one yelling Jehu, and the man
jumped to obey.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring up your carriage at once,” said the young
man, and the fortunate candidate for public patronage
darted off with amazing alacrity to execute the
commission, leaving his patron standing there, with
the sleeping child in his arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hackman had scarcely disappeared when Hanson
was suddenly saluted with a startling clap on the
shoulder and a——</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Hello! By Jove! Where did you come from?
Dropped from the skies?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How are you, Larkins? I’m devilish glad to see
you!” exclaimed Hanson, lying as coolly as he could,
under the circumstances, and extricating his right
hand to offer the newcomer, a tall, young fellow, with
dark hair and mustache, light, gray eyes and pug nose—making
up rather a good-humored, mocking countenance,
and the last man on earth Hanson would
have liked to meet. “Yes, I have dropped from the
skies! In other words, just returned from an infernal
voyage around the Horn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Around the Horn! What the deuce ever took you
around the Horn?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The merchant ship <i>Argonaut</i>, a beastly old wash-trough;
but it is too long a story to tell you now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And—hello!—what the deuce have you got there?
I thought it was your duster thrown over your shoulder,
but now I see it is something alive. What the
mischief is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may well ask. It is an orphan child, for
whom and for whose estates I have the honor to be
appointed guardian and trustee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Holy poker! You appointed guardian of a child!
Why, I should as soon think of your being consecrated
bishop of New York!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So should I,” coolly responded Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll bring the boy up a spendthrift.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A girl! Whe—ew! Pray, are you ordained nursemaid
to an infant girl?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None of your nonsense, Larkins. This responsibility
was thrust upon me suddenly. I did not choose
to retain the young girl who was the child’s maid.
She was too pretty and vivacious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the interests of propriety; I see. I didn’t
know you were so very particular! But, then, I
suppose, being left guardian to a child does ‘solemnize’
a man. But why didn’t you find an old woman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hadn’t time to look one up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to do with the imp?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“‘Imp’ you may well call her,” said Hanson, wincing
at his own reminiscences.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was a deal of trouble on the journey, I dare
say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in the sense I think you mean. But she utterly
repudiates me as her guardian. Favored me with
her opinions in very plain language. Threatened to
‘kick up a row’ if I didn’t take her back to—to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To whom?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To her handsome nursemaid. But she became
very tired and soon went to sleep, and since that
has given me no trouble at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Charming child! But, as I remarked before, what
are you going to do with her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should have taken her to my mother and sister;
but the first news I heard on reaching my native
shores was that they had left theirs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; they sailed for Liverpool a few days ago, I
am sorry to say, on my own account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you and Reba get on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Larkins shrugged his shoulders and made no reply.
“And, by the way, how came you down here? Whom
did you expect to meet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not you, certainly, old chap; though I am deuced
glad to see you. I came to meet the <i>mater</i>, who was
to have arrived by this train from Washington, only
she didn’t come—she never does. I’m used to it. I
shall find a tel. when I get back to Sixty-second
Street.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s my carriage now. Good-by, Larkins. Call
and see me at the Star to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you. By-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The friends parted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson went to the carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Larkins waved his hand and walked off.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hackman jumped down from his box and opened
the door for his fare.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson entered, and laid the child down on the
cushion on the front seat, and sank down into the
back one with a sigh of relief. The child had become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>a burden, and he had not been accustomed to heavy
burdens. He was very tired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where, sir?” inquired Jehu.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First, take these checks and go to the baggage car
and get my valise and hatbox; and don’t be half so
long about it as you were in bringing up the carriage,”
said Hanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So many vehicles ahead of me, sir, couldn’t get
here any sooner,” said the man, as he took the credentials
and darted off as swift as Jove’s Mercury.</p>

<p class='c009'>He soon came back with the properties, which he
piled up on his own seat, not to incommode the inside
passengers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he came around to the door and inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the Star.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jehu closed the door, sprang to his seat, and
started his horses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Twenty minutes’ rapid drive brought them to the
“Star.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now about a quarter to twelve o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving the child sleeping on the cushions, and telling
the hackman to wait, Hanson went into the office
and inquired if he could engage a large bedroom for
himself, with a small one communicating with it for
his little ward, a child between five and six years of
age.</p>

<p class='c009'>He could, on the third floor front, was the answer
he received.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having registered his name—William Hanson, of
New York, and ward—he returned to the carriage,
attended by two porters, one of whom took his valise
and hatbox, and the other the sleeping child.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson paid and discharged the hack, and then
followed the porters into the house—first into the
reception room, and then by the elevator to the third
story, where he was shown into his small suit of two
rooms.</p>

<p class='c009'>One porter set the luggage down on the floor, and
the other laid the sleeping child down on the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson “tipped” them both, and dismissed them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Then he turned up the gas, and went to look at his
poor little charge. A change had come over her. Her
face was flushed, her skin was hot and dry, her lips
parched, her pulse quick, and her breathing short.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor little devil, I am afraid I have done for her!”
said Hanson to himself, in some alarm, as he hastily
and awkwardly unfastened the child’s clothes and
took off her upper garments, her hat, frock, shoes
and stockings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he lifted her in his arms, bore her into the
next room and laid her in the cool, fresh bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if they have put any ice water in the
room?” he said, as he went in search of some.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes; he found a pitcher full, fished out a lump of
ice, broke it into small pieces and put it in a glass.
Then he took a towel, put it in the washbasin, poured
ice water over it, squeezed it out, folded it, and with
that and the pounded ice returned to the little room
and to the child’s bedside.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he bathed her face, laid the cold, wet towel
on her hot and throbbing forehead, and put a thin
flake of ice within her parched lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>She sucked it mechanically and murmured in her
sleep:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady—Ducky Darling—chickies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson sat down beside her, gave her little chips
of ice and renewed the wet towels on her head at
intervals. Her skin seemed getting cooler, her breathing
softer, but her pulse was still very quick.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is going to be ill, I fear. But she is certainly
not in any imminent danger at present,” he said, as
he arose from his chair, lowered the gas and left
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went downstairs to the supper room and ordered
a small but epicurean repast. After he had
partaken of this he passed into the reading room and
looked over all the day’s papers. Finally he lighted
a cigar, and went out for a stroll on the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was after one o’clock when he re-entered the
house and went up to his rooms.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found Owlet much worse than he had left her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>She was burning up with fever, moaning and turning
in her sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This will never do. She is going to be very ill. I
must have a physician in the morning. But what if
he discovers that the child has been drugged? I shall
have to tell him that she has been suffering from
malarial fever, accompanied with severe pain in her
limbs, and that I had to give her morphia on the
train. But I must do what I can for the poor little
wretch to-night. This is not opium poisoning, however.
It is something else. The combined effect of
all that has happened to her to-day. And it need not
be fatal,” Hanson concluded, as he took off his coat
and sat down beside the child to watch her through
the night and cool her scorching head with cold
towels and her parched throat with flakes of ice.</p>

<p class='c009'>No good woman could have been more tender in
her ministrations than was this bad man, though
their motives would have been different—the first
serving from love or benevolence, the second from
selfishness, though something of pity, compunction
and apprehension entered into his motive.</p>

<p class='c009'>He dozed in his armchair by the bedside of the
child, but woke whenever she moaned or tossed, and
moistened her lips with flakes of ice, or cooled her
forehead by a fresh application of a wet towel.</p>

<p class='c009'>So passed the night, until in the gray of the morning,
overcome by fatigue, Hanson fell fast asleep in
his chair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX<br> <span class='c007'>OWLET’S ADVENTURES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was late in the morning when Hanson awoke—awoke
to find the child still worse than on the preceding
night. Her whole face was scarlet, her eyes
now flared open, wild and bloodshot, her lips parched,
her pulse beating almost too fast to be counted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson was at last very much alarmed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Without stopping to slip on his coat, he rang the
bell violently, and soon brought a porter hurrying
to his door to see what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My child is very ill. Ask at once the clerk in the
office to send for the nearest physician.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when the man had gone Hanson dressed himself
in great haste and returned to the bedside of
his stolen charge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Paulet, whose office was on the ground floor
front of the next house on the right, soon came—a
fair, slight, refined-looking man of middle age.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson met him anxiously and took him to the bedside
of his ward.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor made his examination and asked some
questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson answered them all in the way that he had
planned to do, and furthermore gave the same account
of his possession of the child that he had given
to young Larkins.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor made no comment on the story. He
was very reticent. He said, however, that the child
was extremely ill and her recovery doubtful, and that
with Mr. Hanson’s consent he would send a trained
nurse to take care of her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson expressed himself as more than grateful
for the suggestion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Within an hour after the doctor’s departure, a
rosy-cheeked, cheerful-looking woman of about forty
years of age, presented herself with a note from Dr.
Paulet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not until the nurse was installed by the bedside of
the patient did Hanson leave the room to go down
and get his matutinal cup of coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the first time in his life, perhaps, he was beginning
to feel that there were such things as remorse
and fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>For Owlet a dangerous illness followed. Fever and
delirium ran high. She raved incessantly—of all her
short, past life, of her pretty mamma, of the pantomime,
of the ballet, of Santa Claus’ Christmas procession,
of “Lady,” of “Ducky Darling,” of the chickens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the garden, the woods—and she warned divers
persons—notably Hanson and the doctor—that they
were not possessed of common sense; but she recognized
no one, or mistook them for some one else,
and, strangely enough, she never spoke of her abduction.
The events immediately preceding her illness
seemed to be effaced from her memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor was very much interested in the child.
He had heard from Hanson that she was an orphan
heiress, who had been left to his guardianship; that
he should have placed her in the care of his mother
and sister, had not those ladies left the country, for
a summer tour in Europe; that now, if the child
should happily recover, he should engage a nurse
and a governess for her—discreet, middle-aged
women, and have her under his own immediate care
until the return of his mother and sister from abroad.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor warmly commended the prudence of
the youthful guardian, and afterward spoke with enthusiasm
of “that young Hanson” as one of the most
excellent young men it had ever been his good fortune
to meet.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was about this time that Hanson wrote his
cautious letter to Roma Fronde, telling her that the
child was ill unto death, breaking her heart for her
“Lady,” and that she would certainly die unless she
could be restored to her benefactress; but that she
could only be carried home by him—Hanson—and
only on condition that he—Hanson—should be received
with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson waited impatiently, from day to day, for
an answer to this letter; but when five days had
passed, and none had come, he wrote again, in stronger
terms, but with no better success.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he became convinced that she never intended
to notice his letters, no matter how often he might
write.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now he resolved to do, what he had never before
this thought of doing, though Roma had suspected
him of that very baseness. He resolved to
send a private detective down to the neighborhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>of Goeberlin to watch Miss Fronde and find out all
about her—her state, her habits, and her intentions,
and report to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was able and willing to spend a great deal of
money on this venture.</p>

<p class='c009'>He decided to send his man down in the character
of a peddler, who, while traveling about the country
offering his goods to families and their servants,
should make observations and ask questions. He
spared no expense in this evil enterprise. He purchased
a large quantity of miscellaneous goods, and
agreed to give them and all their profits to his agent;
to pay his peddler’s license, his traveling expenses,
his hotel bills, and for the cart and horse the man
would have to buy or hire.</p>

<p class='c009'>For all this he only stipulated that the spy should
keep him—Hanson—informed, by daily letters, of
all Miss Fronde’s daily life.</p>

<p class='c009'>This enterprise was not, however, more successful
than preceding ventures had been.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first news that Hanson received from his spy
was not encouraging to his hopes. Miss Fronde was
not breaking her heart for the loss of her pet, or for
any other cause. That fine young woman was perfectly
well, and actively employed.</p>

<p class='c009'>In partnership with her clergyman and her solicitor,
she was drawing plans and making contracts for
the building of a free school for colored people on
her plantation, and also for a sanatorium for destitute
children and invalids on her seaside estate, the
Isle of Storms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Squandering her fortune in that mad manner!”
exclaimed Hanson, in disgust, forgetting that he himself
squandered ten times as much in yachting, racing,
gambling and more objectionable pursuits. “So
much for trusting women with wealth. She ought to
have a trustee appointed by the courts to take care
of her estates. If I were her next of kin, I know what
I would do. I would soon stop her mad career.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The next news he heard from his spy was to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>effect that Miss Fronde was going to Europe in
August.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is, is she? Then I will go on the same ship
and take the child with me,” said Hanson to himself;
and he wrote back to his man to remain in the neighborhood
until Miss Fronde should leave it for New
York, and to come on the same train with her and
report to him. And if the peddler wanted a new stock
of goods to keep him going Hanson would send them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall see you on the ship, my lady. You can’t
get away from me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Owlet had safely passed the crisis of her
illness, and was recovering slowly, very slowly. Her
return to consciousness was very gradual and intermittent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though she was gathering some strength of body,
she remained strangely feeble in intellect. She
seemed to have forgotten the details of her abduction,
but not the existence of her dear “Lady.” She begged
piteously to be taken back to her “darling Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was promised that she should go to her Lady
as soon as she should be well enough to travel, and
so she was put off from time to time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson told the nurse and the doctor that the
lady she talked so much about had been her nursery
governess, to whom she had been much attached;
advised her to humor the child, yet warned her to
try to divert Owlet’s attention from the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>But that was quite impossible. “Lady” was the
one absorbing subject of her thoughts by day, and of
her dreams by night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet was a piteous little object as she sat propped
up in a large, white, dimly-covered resting-chair, with
her knees and feet wrapped around with a white
coverlet. Her face was as pale and thin as a living
face could be, and her great, brown eyes, which looked
larger than ever in the little, pinched face, had taken
on a pathetic, imploring expression which it was very
sorrowful to see.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanson seemed very good to her. He bought her
toys, picture books, trinkets, but she turned away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>her sick eyes from them all, and pleaded to be taken
home to Lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later, when she was well enough to wear them,
Hanson bought for her very pretty dresses, hats and
coral necklaces and armlets. But she looked at them
with weary, indifferent eyes, and prayed to be taken
to Lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>One beautiful, bright Saturday, when she was well
enough to go out, Hanson got an open carriage and
took her, with the nurse, to Central Park to hear the
music.</p>

<p class='c009'>To almost any child seeing it for the first time,
especially on Saturday, with the bands of music and
the thousands of children, and the variety of sports,
the sunshine, the trees, the flowers, the lakes and
ponds, it must have seemed the Garden of Eden revived—a
heaven on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>But for homesick and heartsick, pale and large-eyed
little Owlet it had no pleasures.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look how beautiful it is!” said Hanson. “Don’t
you like it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not half as well as Lady’s garden! Oh, take me
there!” pleaded the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall go as soon as you are well enough,”
Hanson answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen to the music, my dear. Isn’t it delightful?”
suggested the nurse, as the whole brass band struck
up some jubilant martial air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d rather hear Lady sing ‘Come Sound His Praise
Abroad,’ or Ducky Darling turn the little broken
music box, than the whole of this! Oh! take me back
to them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again she was promised to have her will as soon
as she should be able.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Owlet was beginning to disbelieve in promises,
and to lay out plans for herself—idiotic little plans,
indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The child was like some poor, little, forsaken,
puzzled pet dog, pining for its absent mistress, not
knowing how it had been separated from her, longing
to find her, but ignorant where to look for her in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the wilderness of the world, in all the despairful immensity
of space.</p>

<p class='c009'>And like this poor, silly, helpless little quadruped,
Owlet felt an irresistible instinct to go away and look
for her beloved all over the great earth until she
should find her.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a cunning beyond her years—a cunning, however,
which is often found in connection with imbecility
of mind, and even with idiocy—she concealed
her purpose and watched for her opportunity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet was never left alone except when her nurse
would go down to meals—fifteen minutes for breakfast,
twenty for dinner—until sunset, when Mrs. Gilbert
would put the child to bed, arrange her comfortably
for the night, leave her safe in the little room,
while generally Hanson would be reading or writing
in the larger room, and go downstairs to join the other
ladies’ maids and children’s nurses at their tea, and
where all those whose duties, like those of Mrs. Gilbert,
were over for the day, would remain gossiping
together for an indefinite time.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the opportunity which the poor, forlorn,
homesick child resolved to seize, on the first occasion
on which Hanson also should be absent from the
outer room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The occasion came at length.</p>

<p class='c009'>One afternoon in the early days of May, just as the
sun was setting clear behind the hills of New Jersey,
Mrs. Gilbert undressed Owlet, put her to bed, and
then went down to her tea and her two hours’ gossip.
Soon after Hanson came in, dressed for a party, and
kissed Owlet good night. She heard him leave the
room, and then she got out of bed and dressed herself
in her very best clothes, and put on her prettiest
coral necklace and armlets, and her finest hat, made
up a little bundle of clothes and pinned them in a
paper, and then left the room and went down—not
by the elevator, but by the stairs—and passed from
the house through the “ladies’ entrance,” without
attracting any attention from anyone but the porter,
who opened the door for her, without any suspicion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>that there was anything irregular in her going out
in that self-possessed, matter-of-fact manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gas had just been lighted on the streets, and
the scene was very brilliant. The shops were fairy
palaces. But Owlet did not stop to look at any of
them, she was much too eager to hurry to “Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had no idea of the distance that separated her
from her beloved. Goblin Hall was out of the city
among the trees somewhere. And people must know
where it was, and she would inquire for it, as soon
as she should see some one who was not in such an
awful hurry as all the folks seemed to be on this
street.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Owlet of a month before would not have hesitated
to stop the busiest man on the sidewalk and
ask to be directed, but the Owlet of to-day was sad,
subdued and timid, and so she walked a long distance
down Broadway, until she came in sight of the trees
in City Hall Park, and was ready to drop with fatigue,
for she was still very weak. She had not found courage
to speak to any of the crowd, until, at length, she
saw an old woman, very old, very dirty, and very
ragged, sitting on a cellar door, against the wall of
a house, and with a huge bundle of foul smelling rags
on her lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet only perceived the poverty, and not the
wickedness of the personality before her. She said
to herself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This old woman is not proud, nor busy, nor in
a hurry. I will ask her, and I reckon she will know;
and when I get to Goblin Hall I will have Lady give
her some new clothes, and some——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she stopped before the wretch, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, ma’am, will you show me the way to Goblin
Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goblet which?” demanded the crone, who seemed
to be rather deaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goblin Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Goblet Hall! I dunno sich a place. Is it a
s’loon or mus’um?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what is a s’loon or mus’um, ma’am.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Goblin Hall is a fine house where Lady lives. It has
trees, and flowers, and chickens and Ducky Darling.
And, please, I am lost, and can’t find it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you are lost?” inquired the crone, devouring,
with her eyes the rich dress, the fine hat and the
coral trinkets worn by the child, and the bundle
carried in her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am, please, lost; and I want to go home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you say you wanted to go to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Goblin Hall, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I know the place! I’ll take yer straight
there, my little lady,” said the hag, gloating over
the finery of the child, and counting how many glasses
of rum she could buy with the money for which she
could pawn the hat, the dress, the coral ornaments,
and the contents of the bundle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! thank you, ma’am. Lady will——” Owlet was
about to add, “pay you well for bringing me home,”
but an innate delicacy caused her to pause before
offering so poor a woman pay for a kind action, and
to say, instead—“will be ever so much obliged to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. Come along o ’me,” said the hag, hoisting
her huge bundle upon her shoulders, rising and
taking the child’s hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XX<br> <span class='c007'>OWLET’S GREAT PERIL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“W’at be yer sniffing at, young un?” demanded the
horrible creature, as she drew the child along, hurrying
as fast as she could down a narrow, crowded
street leading out of East Broadway into, perhaps,
the most poverty stricken, squalid, Heaven-forsaken
quarter of the city. “W’at be yer sniffing at?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You,” quietly answered truthful Owlet, without a
moment’s hesitation, yet without meaning offense.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Me! I’m not nice enough for you, ain’t I, my
fine little Feather?” inquired the crone.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Owlet looked at her.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was a tall, large-boned, strong old woman, with
harsh features, small, deep-set, pale gray eyes, dark,
leathery skin, and straggling, iron-gray hair. She
was clothed in a petticoat and sack, dark and thick
of material, darker and thicker with accumulations
of dirt, and half in rags. Over her head and shoulders
she wore a very ragged old plaid shawl, with the
pattern obliterated by dirt. On her shoulders she
bore a huge bundle of rags—a ragpicker by trade,
evidently, very poor probably, though some of her
sort have been known to save and hoard large sums
of money; very wicked, possibly, yet, in any case,
to be more pitied than blamed, certainly. Who are
we, who have received sane mental and moral natures
from our forefathers, and have been trained
amid favorable circumstances, to judge our less fortunate
brothers and sisters of this world? We know
so little. We can but have faith in the Lord and
charity for them, and with all humility in ourselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not nice enough for you, eh?” repeated the woman,
as they turned another corner and dived down another
narrow, wretched street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you take a bath and put on clean
clothes?” inquired Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t I take a bath and put on clean clothes?
Oh, the innocent arsks me why I don’t take a bath
and put on clean clothes! Oh, he, he, he!” chuckled
the ragpicker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady bathes and changes her clothes every blessed
day. And so do I. Why don’t you?” persisted Owlet,
in the interests of health and cleanliness and—of her
own nose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She and you is rich belike, and I be poor,” replied
the crone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But water is cheap enough. Everybody can get
as much water as they want to wash with. Why
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, Fine Feathers, I ain’t the time to
waste in washing. I has to work for my living, I
has.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Oh!” said the child, accepting the excuse and trying
to understand it.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she turned her head away from the ragpicker
to try to catch a whiff of fresh air from the end of
the street, that ran to the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A-sniffing ag’in,” said the hag.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t help it, ma’am,” Owlet said, in apology.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she can’t help sniffing! Fine Feathers can’t
help sniffing! He, he, he! If she can’t ’elp sniffing
out here in the hopen air, ’ow will she stand it in
the ’ouse? Oh, deary me!” muttered the crone to
nobody in particular, as she turned the last corner
in their progress through this hell and entered a dark
and narrow alley more poverty stricken, squalid and
Heaven-forsaken than any thoroughfare they had yet
passed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The alley ran through the middle of an old city
square, and was flanked on each side by dilapidated
brick buildings that had once been the stables, coach
houses, etc., of the rich dwellers in the mansions
fronting on the streets of the square. But as these
mansions had long been turned into stores, saloons
and workshops, so the outhouses had been converted
into tenements of the most objectionable description.
But if there were no street lamps in this alley, neither
was there a “dive” or a “bucket shop,” which might
account for the quietness as well as the darkness of
the place.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun had so long set that even the twilight
had faded away. No light reached the alley except
from the distant lamps of the two streets upon which
it opened, and from an occasional lamp in a few of
the buildings.</p>

<p class='c009'>So at this hour there was not much to be seen,
but very much too much to be smelt, for a fetid gutter
ran, or rather stagnated, through the middle of the
alley, and seemed to be the receptacle of all the slops
from all the wretched tenements on either side of the
way.</p>

<p class='c009'>These buildings were all in the last stages of dilapidation
in which it was possible for human beings to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>find shelter with safety. Walls were moldering away;
doors and window shutters broken off their hinges
or hanging by one hinge, or by a leather substitute;
sashes without glass, and the place of it supplied
with foul and pestilential rags.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a thickly crowded yet not a noisy place. In
fact, it was so quiet and almost deserted that it was
safe to suppose the wretched inhabitants who were
not in the tumbling tenements were off to those favorite
resorts, the “dives” and “bucket shops” of the
neighboring streets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some very few miserable children, and fewer still
of more miserable women, might be dimly seen, here
and there, squatting on the falling front steps of the
buildings, or loitering about them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like this place,” said Owlet, as soon as they
had turned into the alley; “I don’t like this place one
bit. I wouldn’t live here for a dollar. I didn’t know
we had to come through this place to get to Lady’s
house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, dearie little Fine Feathers. This is the
way from where you came to where Lady lives—the
only way, too. You can’t go no other way not at
all,” said the crone, in a conciliating tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, then I am so sorry. Oh, do let’s get out of
here as fast as we can—Oh, phew! what makes people
live in such a nasty place as this when there is ever
so much big, beautiful country in the world?” said
Owlet, holding her nose between thumb and finger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, the blooming innocent! she arsks why people
live in such a nasty place as this? Lord, I wonder
if she thinks they choose?” inquired the ragpicker
of the universe at large. Then looking in contemptuous
pity on the ignorance of her little companion, she
answered to the point: “’Cause they can’t ’elp it.
They’s too blooming poor to be let live anywhere
else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I am so sorry for them! But, please hurry!
I can walk faster if I try. This place does make me
so sick!—sick at my stomach! I—I’m afraid I shall
throw up presently,” said Owlet, beginning to gag.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“Hold on, Feathers! Oh, hold on! We’ll soon get
there now! Here, smell this ’bacco,” said the ragpicker,
drawing from her bosom a quid of “Old Pig”
and offering it to the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no!—Oh, I can’t!—It—I can’t!—Oh, please
hurry!” panted the child, in great bodily distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now, if as ’ow yer can’t ’bide this one minnit,
’ow do yer think the poor souls as ’ave to live here
all the blooming days of their lives—day in and day
out, night in and night out—can a-bear it?” demanded,
and not without reason, the animated mass of rags
and filth by Owlet’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, the poor people! Oh, I am so awful sorry for
them! I will ask Lady as soon as ever I get home to
take them out of this horrid place, and give them lovely
houses and sweet gardens in the beautiful country.
Lady is awful rich, you know! And good! Oh, so
good! You don’t know—oh, you don’t know how
good she is!” said Owlet, with a philanthropist’s
enthusiasm, forgetting her disgust in her ardor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she’ll do it!” exclaimed the crone, with a
harsh laugh of scornful incredulity—“Oh, she’ll do it!
You may depend she’ll do it! I never seed her face
to face, but I know as she’ll do every bit of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed, she will!” replied ignorant and confident
Owlet; but she faltered as she spoke, and began
to totter as she walked, for the stench of that
pest place was penetrating, acrid, insistent. Owlet
was again overpowered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, please—go fast—hurry—hurry—out of this—or
I shall—drop down—dead!” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my pretty little Fine Feathers; in one minute.
You see, I live here, dearie—I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You!” exclaimed the child, momentarily revived by
her astonishment, and interrupting the hag’s speech;
but the next instant wondering at herself for being
the least surprised, for it seemed so natural that this
creature should live in just this place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the ragpicker, “I bide here, dearie, and
I just want to step inter my place one minnit to get
my bunnit to put on my head, to dress myself up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>it, you know, so as to be decent to go afore genteel
folks like your lady is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stopped before the very worst of all the rookeries
in that alley, if that could be said of a house in
a place where all houses were as bad as bad could be,
and every one worse than the other—so to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along o’ me, Fine Feathers,” said the hag,
leading the unfortunate child up a short flight of
rickety, shaking steps, and through a front door that
stood wide open, into a hall that was even a little
more filthy than the alley from which they had
entered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The only light within it gleamed through partly
open doors of tenement rooms on either side, with
interiors indescribably squalid, and from which came
odors insupportably nauseous. The tenement, in
fact, seemed to be a colony of ragpickers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dim, gleaming light from the doors ajar showed
a narrow, moldering, broken staircase that led to the
floor above.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along o’ me now, dearie,” said the crone, in
a coaxing tone, as she took a faster hold on the child’s
hand and began to draw her up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!—if you please—do take me—out of this—I—I—am
dy—dy——”</p>

<p class='c009'>And here Owlet fainted away, succumbing to the
weakness of an imperfect convalescence, to great
weariness, and, finally, to the deadly fetor of the
pestilential house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! by jingo!” exclaimed the crone, as she
picked up the child, still very thin and light from
her recent illness, and easily carried her up the
rickety stairs, that creaked and bent under her footsteps,
to the upper hall, which was flanked each side
by tenement rooms, through whose partly open doors
gleamed flickering lights and streamed foul odors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This here is better nor I could ’oped. Saves a
desprit deal o’ trouble,” said the ragpicker, as she
bore the unconscious child to the rear of the hall,
and paused at a door on the lefthand side, which
she pushed open with her foot.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>It gave into a very small room, no bigger than a
good-sized closet. It had but one window, a small,
rear window, partly lighted by a distant lamp that
stood in line with it on a cross street. The only
furniture consisted of a huge pile of inconceivably
foul rags that lay on the floor in one corner, reached
halfway up to the low ceiling, and spread more than
halfway over the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman laid the child down on the edge of the
pile of rags, and found a match and an end of candle,
which she lighted and stuck into the neck of an
empty beer bottle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must make haste and git rid on her afore she
comes to, and then she won’t give no trouble to nobody.
Lor’, ’ow lucky she swooned hoff in this here
way! Lor’, to think as ’ow I have been ’elped this day
in this onexpected manner! First, I comes upon this
here fine bird, with fine feathers, lost into the streets,
and with waluable jewelry onto her neck, and a waluable
bundle into her hand—and where is that bundle,
by the same token? ’Opes it never dropped on the
stairs. No! Lor’, there it is, hanging onto Fine
Feathers’ arm still. Never dropped hoff when she
fainted, and I picked her up! Oh! w’at luck this is!
And to find the fortin in the street! And to bring
her here! And jest as I were a-thinking how on airth
I could get the clothes offen her back ’thout her raising
the whole alley, she jest faints away like a angel,
so quiet and comfortable! It do seem like a providence,
it do, indeed it do! I wonder what’s in that
bundle? But I ain’t got time to look now. Lor’, no.
I must get Fine Feathers outen this afore she comes
to, or there’ll be trouble. Lor’, yes,” concluded the
crone, as she hastily drew Owlet’s bundle off her arm
and hid it far under the pile of rags.</p>

<p class='c009'>She need not have been in such haste. The swooning
child was not likely to recover in that deadly
room. She was much more likely to die as people
die in the fumes of escaping gas or burning charcoal
in an airtight place.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ragpicker sat down flat upon the floor, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>drew the unconscious child gently across her lap, and
proceeded to divest her of her costly trinkets and
rich clothing, all of which she made into a bundle
and thrust it far under the pile of rags.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she looked at the beautiful, nude statue of a
child that lay upon the floor, and considered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Twon’t do to take her out that-a-way. But w’at
shall I put onto her? Not a child’s garment in all
that pile. Oh! I know,” she suddenly mumbled. “I
roll her in my shawl. I can get another one to-morrow
outen the fortin I have come inter. Them
there jew’ls and frock and things’ll fetch a pile, I
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, she took off her own ragged shawl,
laid it over her knees, drew the nude and senseless
form of the child upon it, and rolled her up in it,
securing it here and there by scraps of strings drawn
from the pile, and run through the holes of the wrap.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’ll do,” she said, as she took little Owlet in
her arms, laid her head over her shoulder and left
the room, on this occasion taking the precaution to
lock the door and put the key in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never do lock my door, except when I’m gwine
to bed; but I guess I’ll do it now, fear of accidents.
Though nobody’ll never guess nothing ’bout the fortin
as I’ve got locked up in there. Lor’, no! They’ll only
think, if any on ’em come and try my door, as I’ve
turned in airlier, and some on ’em liars’ll say drunker
nor usual. They’ll never think of the fortin. Lor’,
no! If they did, it wouldn’t be there long. Lor’, no!
So I reckon as I had better hurry and get back’s soon
as I can, anyhow,” she concluded, as she went down
the stairs, dark or only dimly lighted by the gleam of
candles, or kerosene lamps, from the partly open
doors of the tenement rooms.</p>

<p class='c009'>She passed downstairs without being questioned,
or even observed, until she reached the front door,
where a woman sat on the steps, smoking a short,
clay pipe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Umphe—humphe! There’s Kit, as us’al, filling up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>the door,” muttered the ragpicker, as she came upon
the smoker.</p>

<p class='c009'>The latter took the pipe from between her lips,
looked up, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Evenin’! What’s that you’ve got there, Muck?”
calling the crone by the nickname that had been
given her in recognition of her pre-eminent attainments
in squalor.</p>

<p class='c009'>At any other time the Malebolge of her poor, obscene
and profane soul would have been turned upon
the questioner and deluged her with abuse. But it
was now her cue to be conciliating.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, jest one of my Soph’s young uns as has been
spending of the hevening and taking tea along of
me. And I’m a-carrying of her home to her mammy,”
she answered, quite civilly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ain’t seen Soph since she come from the island.
Where is she now?” inquired the younger woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Got a room in Rose Street.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bloomin’ Rose Street that one is. He-he! Where
is Soph’s man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’ere he ought to be. W’ere I ’ope he’ll stay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sent up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drinking?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and beating of his wife. Wish I’d caught him
at it. Better not let me catch him when he comes
out, either. There’ll be a foot race or a fun’al. More
like the fun’al. And me sent furder up nor him, I
reckon—for manslaughter it mought be, and serve
him right. But, here! Let me pass. It’s arfter
nine, and I want to get along with Soph’s kid, ’fear
she’ll be oneasy ’bout her. ’Cause, yer see, she don’
know w’ere she is. I picked her up in the streets, and
fetched her home to take tea ’long of me,” the ragpicker
explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! to take tea long of you?” Kit questioned, with
a dry laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, why not?” demanded the crone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, nothing. Only I was wondering what stood for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>tea, and what on earth it was made in and drunk
out of. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The ragpicker would have liked to strangle the
young woman then and there, but she dared not even
quarrel with her, so she answered, with a forced
laugh:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yer will have your jokes, Kit. Well, to be
sure the tea were only a bottle of ginger beer, drunk
outen the bottle, and a bun eat outen the hand. I
forgive yer yer little joke, Kit, my lass. But I haven’t
got time to stop now. I must take the child home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kit laughed, replaced the pipe in her mouth, and
moved aside.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ragpicker passed out to the alley with Owlet
in her arms, the child’s head over the woman’s
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>The crone would have been made anxious by the
child’s long swoon, but that she felt the gentle motion
of the little one’s lungs against her own breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>She walked down to the end of the alley, and turned
the corner into a crowded street leading down to the
East River.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fresh night breeze from the sea began to revive
the fainting child, who moved and sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there, dearie, it’s all right. Don’t be
afeared, my pretty little Lady Fine Feathers. It’s
only me toting of you home to your dear Lady. Yes,
dearie,” whispered the thief.</p>

<p class='c009'>The exhausted child, scarcely cognizant of herself—not
at all of her surroundings—heaved a deep sigh of
weariness, and subsided into quietness.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ragpicker walked on, watching her opportunity
to drop and leave the child when she could feel sure
of doing so without being observed.</p>

<p class='c009'>She met and passed, jostled and was jostled by
many foot passengers on the sidewalks, and she saw
and was seen by several policemen, any one of whom
would have stopped and “run her in” had he had the
slightest suspicion of the crime she was committing.
But the sight of a ragged woman with a ragged child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>in her arms was a sight too common to draw remark,
much less to excite suspicion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ragpicker, however, soon left the more crowded
and busier street, and turned into a less frequented
and quieter one.</p>

<p class='c009'>She knew all the mazes in the labyrinth of that
quarter, and she turned and wound among them like
the crawling serpent that might have been her type.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length she found what she had been seeking
from the time she had set out on her walk with the
child in her arms—a narrow, quiet street that seemed
at this hour to be deserted of all pedestrian life.
Lights gleamed from the windows of the tall tenements
on either side; but no one seemed to be abroad.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here she looked up and down the street, and then
sat down on a cellar door, against the front wall of
one of the tallest houses, shifted the position of the
child from her shoulder to her knees, and took another
survey of her surroundings.</p>

<p class='c009'>One solitary pedestrian came down the same sidewalk
where she sat with the child on the cellar door,
and passed by within two feet of her without perceiving
her in the deep shadows.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he was gone the thoroughfare was vacant.
The stage was waiting, so to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old wretch seized the opportunity. She raised
the sleeping child and stood up, looked about, and
prepared to lay her under the steps of the front stoop
beside the cellar door, when, to her confusion, Owlet
moved, awoke, lifted her head and inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are we almost there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman knew now that she must soothe and
deceive the child with some plausible pretext for
leaving her alone for a minute—a minute in which
she should make her retreat. Else, if she did not do
this, the child would be frightened, would cry, and—though
she saw no policeman—there might be one not
too far off. So she answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dearie. Pretty little Lucky Fine Feathers, we
is almost there. In fact, almost at the door. But will
you jest bide quiet here a minnit while I go over there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>and ask that boy which is the best way to get ’round
to the house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it a black boy?” Owlet inquired, unconsciously
asking a leading question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dearie, werry black,” answered the ragpicker,
intelligently following the lead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then that is Puck—poor, dear, old Puck! But he’s
not a boy really, though they call him so, because he’s
so little, I s’pose, or because they forgot to call him
anything else. But he is a man grown, a married man,
too, and Ducky Darling’s uncle,” said Owlet, brightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! is he? Then I’ll go and speak to him directly,”
said the ragpicker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do! And tell him you have found me. And
tell him I want to see them all awful bad, and I’m
coming home directly. And, oh! won’t he be glad?
And won’t Lady and Ducky Darling and all of them
be glad? Just as glad as I shall be. For, oh! I know
they have all been grieving about me as much as I
have been about them. Now we shall be so glad!
And you shall be glad, too. And the poor people in
that horrid place—I must have gone dead again. How
did you get me out of it?” suddenly inquired Owlet,
trying to piece together the broken threads of her
memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brung you out of it, dearie, while you was in a
dead faint,” said the woman, impatient to be off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That—must—have—been so,” said the child, very
solemnly—then she added: “Oh, the poor people
what have to live there all the time! I don’t believe
Lady knows about it, or she wouldn’t let them. But
I’ll tell her. And she will take them out of it, and
you, too, and everybody shall be glad. Lady is like an
angel in heaven in her lovely home and garden. She
don’t know anything about such——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hells!” added the crone. “And now I’ll go and
fetch the black boy to tote you home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; go,” said Owlet, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The crone turned away, muttering to herself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll do. ’Tain’t a cold night for the last of
April. And she’s well wrapped up in my ole shawl,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>too. Lor’, yes. And the perlice’ll find her presently,
and then she’ll be took to the station and took care
on. And, Lor’, it’s little account she can give of herself
to they. It’s little account she could give to me,
as was like a gran’mother to her, toting her in my
arms as if she’d been one of Soph’s own kids. And,
after all, the Ventures of Cruelty will care on her till
her own people turn up. Lor’, yes. She’ll be all
right. No fear for her; them rich allers falls onto
their feet, somehows,” concluded the ragpicker.</p>

<p class='c009'>And with this “flattering unction” laid to her
paralyzed but not quite deadened conscience, she
turned the next corner and wound in and out through
the labyrinth of streets and alleys that lay between
the spot on which she had left the desolate child and
the den which she called her home.</p>

<p class='c009'>She reached the room at length, opened the door,
lighted her stump of tallow candle, and searched for
her stolen booty in the pile of rags.</p>

<p class='c009'>She found them safe. She drew them out and
gloated over them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally she selected the coral necklace for immediate
investment and replaced all the other treasures
under the malodorous pile of rags.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she went forth again, and on this occasion
to the nearest pawnbroker’s shop.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here she pledged the necklace for two dollars, with
which she bought, at the next groggery, a half gallon
of uncommonly poisonous whisky, even as whisky
goes, and then she went back to her den with joyful
anticipations to lock herself in and have what she
called “a glorious drunk” all to herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Owlet, hidden under the front steps of
that tall house, waited fearlessly and patiently, without
the slightest idea that she had been left to her
fate.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now the change in her clothing, which in her
intense interest in the prospect of getting home to
“Lady’s house” she had scarcely noticed before, began
to trouble her. It irritated her skin and offended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>her nose. Still the foul envelope did not suggest foul
play to the unsuspicious child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It must have rained while I was gone dead,” she
said to herself, “and that poor, ragged woman took
off my wet clothes and hung them up to dry, and
wrapped me in her poor old shawl. It was all she
had, too, poor thing. And it was very good of her.
Still, I do wish she hadn’t. I would rather be soaked
to the skin than be so very, very nasty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then a policeman passed on his beat. Owlet
saw him on the lighted sidewalk, but she did not
know him for a policeman, and he did not see her,
all in the deep shadow of the stoop.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still she waited patiently, almost stupidly. It was
strange that she felt no fear, for she did not; strange,
also, that she was growing indifferent, almost unconscious
of her noisome change of clothes, for she
was. She was becoming dazed and stupefied by her
present state and by all that she had gone through
since her flight, and even before she was driven to
that flight which was so desperate a venture for a
child only six years old.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes she dozed and started, waked up suddenly,
and tried to gather her scattered thoughts, and
wondered why it took so long a time for her new
friend to fetch Puck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I reckon they have gone on to the house to
tell Lady I am found, and to fetch the carriage to
take me home, for, after all, the house must be a good
way off from here for me to walk, or for Puck to
carry me. And Lady will come herself, I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With this thought in her mind, the weary child
sank to sleep, and dreamed of being in “Lady’s”
garden of delight, among the glorious flowers, or
down the gooseberry walk, or beside the coop where
the bantam “chickies” ran in and out, with Ducky
Darling cooing to them. So passed the hours of that
April night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI<br> <span class='c007'>WILL HARCOURT’S ADVENTURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When Will Harcourt had answered Roma Fronde’s
confiding and affectionate note by a letter of vague
confession and final renunciation, he looked upon his
own life as “done and finished,” so far as any hope
in the future was concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>What had he to live for?</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma, his adored, his ideal woman, his muse, his
goddess, was lost to him forever! was worse than
lost, for she was repulsed, repudiated, and by himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>His youthful ambition was gone forever; was worse
than gone, for it was turned to humiliation, and by
his own act.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, misery! Oh, misery!</p>

<p class='c009'>What had he to live for, indeed?</p>

<p class='c009'>What?</p>

<p class='c009'>For one bitter end! To expiate his sin! To toil
hard at the roughest sort of work, among honest
laborers, with whom he did not feel good enough to
associate, to look forward to nothing better than the
coming of that bitter day which should deprive him
of his only friend in the death of his aged mother,
and leave him free to deliver his conscience of his
guilty secret, nay, constrain him to denounce himself
as a criminal, to give himself up to justice, to be
dealt with according to law, to suffer—what penalty?</p>

<p class='c009'>Imprisonment, with penal servitude, for the term
of his natural life, must be the lightest doom that
could be meted out to him, as the measure of his
great offense.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the term of his natural life. And he was but
twenty-four years old! A half century of imprisonment
and penal slavery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, let it come, he thought, not defiantly, indeed,
but humbly. He had deserved it all. And, long as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>it might last, it would end some time. And there was
an after life, where faith, repentance and reformation
in this world would surely be followed by rest,
peace and joy in that world to come, where, also, as
some believed, true lovers severed here would meet
to part no more forever, because from their creation
their souls had been essentially one, though apparently
two.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, if this should be true, as some deep inspiration
whispered that it surely was—man might bear
patiently, hopefully, courageously all that the world,
the flesh and the devil might inflict upon him even
the hardest of all to bear the disgrace and penalty of
his own sin and folly.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this mood of mind Harcourt reached New York
late one evening toward the last of April.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went directly to his lodgings, passed up the
four flights of stairs to the attic floor, and paused a
moment in the passage before his own and his neighbor’s
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>There he heard the old, familiar thumper-thumper-thumper-thumper
of Annie Moss’ sewing machine, going
on as he had heard it all the time he had lived in
the next room, as he had heard it on the evening he
had taken leave of her, as if it had never stopped
during the three weeks of his absence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, these poor working women!” he thought.
“How patient they are, at their monotonous work!
What a lesson it is to others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He rapped at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well! Who is it?” inquired the pleasant voice, as
the sound of the machine stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is I, Annie,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although she was old enough to be his mother, he
had got to calling her “Annie,” because everybody
else did, so far as he knew—Adler and Adler’s wife
and their children, all called Mrs. Moss Annie. The
name seemed to suit the fair, gentle, helpful woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. William, I am so glad that you have come
back,” she said, as she opened the door.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“And I am very glad to see you. I hope you are
well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, very well, thank you, Mr. William. I am
always well, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And happy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and happy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You deserve to be so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know that I do. I hope you left your
mother well, Mr. William.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As well as most women are at her advanced age.
My dear mother is nearer eighty than seventy, you
must know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then so much nearer to her eternal youth,” sweetly
and solemnly replied Annie Moss.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” assented Harcourt, in a low tone, “that is
all she has to comfort her now—the prospect of the
future better life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Many young people, as well as the aged, have
nothing else to hope for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is indeed true, Annie; but I do not know how
so good and happy a woman as yourself should have
found it out,” said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in, Mr. William, and sit down and rest yourself,
while I make a cup of tea that will refresh you
after your journey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you. Not now. I only came to see how
you are, and to get my key,” replied the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But your room has been shut up, and without
a fire in it for nearly a month, and though I have aired
it two or three times a week I know it is cold and
damp, and you are just off a long journey. You had
better come in, and let me get you a cup of tea, and
after you have taken it you will feel better able to
tackle with a damp room and a cold hearth. Come
in, now. Why not? Are we not all brethren and
sisters?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! my dear Annie, you are really too good for
this world,” said Harcourt, very stupidly, it must be
admitted, for he even thought so himself, yet in perfect
good faith.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Nonsense! There are no provisions laid up in
your room, either, and I’d like to know what you
expect to do about supper at this time of night, when
all the stores are closed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt smiled, and submitted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although Annie Moss called her neighbor so formally
“Mr. William,” she really considered him as
something like a foster son.</p>

<p class='c009'>She made him sit down in the only armchair, where
he drew off his gloves, put them in his hat, set that
on the floor, and made himself comfortable, while
Annie filled her kettle and set it on the stove, and
laid a clean cloth on the table in preparation for tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is work now, Annie?” he inquired, while she
flitted from cupboard to table, and back and forth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Plentiful with me; I have just as much as I can
jump at,” she answered, brightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And work fourteen hours out of the twenty-four.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sometimes, yes. It don’t hurt me. I always sleep
so well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear it. How is work with Adler?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he has got a steady job on the new railroad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad to hear that, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it strange, Mr. William, that Adler has
never been out of work a day since that night when
you saved his life. Oh! it must be a glorious thing
to save life—especially the life of a young father of
a family!” said Annie Moss.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know I saved his life, Annie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! why, Adler told me himself; and so did his
wife. They have told dozens of people. They will
never forget the ‘good turn’ you did him, as they
call it; and they say, besides, it turned his luck, for
he has never been out of employment since; and now
he has got a job on the new railroad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if I could work on that road?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I think so. Adler told me only last night
that they wanted more laborers,” said Annie Moss,
as she set the tea to draw, and placed plates of bread,
butter and cold corned beef on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor and plain as was her home in the attic of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>the four-storied tenement house, Annie Moss lived
better than most of the needle women in the city.
She had no one but herself to support, and as she
slept well, ate well and lived cleanly, she had good
health and great capacity for work.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the feast was spread she invited Harcourt
to draw up his chair—the armchair in which he sat,
she said, for he would be more comfortable in that.</p>

<p class='c009'>He obeyed her gratefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>She also sat down at the table, saying that she had
not yet taken her own tea and would join him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie Moss was pleased to see that her guest made
a very satisfactory supper.</p>

<p class='c009'>After it was finished, Harcourt thanked his hostess,
and, as it was now very late, asked for the key of his
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie got it for him, and then lighted a candle and
gave it to him. He thanked her, bade her good-night,
and went to his apartment. He found the place as
damp, chilly and comfortless as Annie had predicted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I had had the sense to write to this good
woman, and named the day I was to come back, she
would have had everything ready for me, fire made
and room aired,” he said to himself, as he raised the
window looking out on the bay, and went to the cupboard,
from the floor of which he got some waste
paper and kindlings, which he piled on the cold
hearth, and lighted from the candle Annie had given
him with the key.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had soon a bright blaze without a hot fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>And between the open window and the blazing
hearth the atmosphere of the room was soon improved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, about midnight, he retired to bed. But he
was an uneasy sleeper, and had been so ever since
that fatal fifteenth of September, when he fell under
the power of the tempter and descended into the
inferno.</p>

<p class='c009'>He passed a restless night, and with the earliest
dawn of day he arose and dressed himself, went out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>to buy his breakfast, came in in a few minutes, kindled
his fire, made his coffee and cooked his chops.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had eaten his meal and set his room in
order, he took his hat and set out to see Adler, and
find out what was his chance of getting work.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was still very early in the morning; the sun but
newly risen.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found Adler at breakfast, surrounded by his
family.</p>

<p class='c009'>They all started up from the table to welcome their
returned friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adler pressed him to join them at the meal; but
Harcourt thanked him, and declined upon the reasonable
ground that he had just finished his own breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took the chair that one of the children brought
him, and sat down, answering all their kindly questions
about his mother and himself, and asking some
few of them concerning their welfare, until at last
Adler arose from the table to go to his work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll excuse me, William. It is after six o’clock,
and you know I have to go,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will walk with you as far as the car,” Harcourt
answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. I shall be glad to have your company.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt bade good-by to the family, and the two
men walked out together.</p>

<p class='c009'>On their way, Harcourt made known his wish to
get work on the road.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand you, William! I don’t, indeed!
I can’t see the use of a highly educated man like you
hankering after this sort of work, hanged if I can!”
said Adler.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have discussed this subject before, my friend.
You know my mind,” replied the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, get in the car with me, and come along
up. The contractor wants more hands than he can
get just now. And—here comes our car.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the car approached the crossing Adler hailed
it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Both men boarded it, and were soon on their way
uptown.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt found no difficulty in getting work. He
was taken on at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>And from this day his routine of hard, daily labor
began.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wrote regularly to his mother, two letters each
week, and he heard from her frequently, either by
notes from herself or from Margaret Wynthrop. He
knew that the aged lady continued in fair bodily
health, though she did not improve in mental strength.
His only satisfaction in thinking of her was that she
was happy, comfortable, well cared for, and without
the slightest suspicion of the straits to which her
poor, only son had been reduced.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he labored on—humbly, patiently, heroically, as
one waiting for an anticipated but an unknown denouément.</p>

<p class='c009'>And what denouément?</p>

<p class='c009'>He had acquired a habit, forced upon him by circumstances,
of retiring early at night and rising with
the dawn of day. He sometimes took a walk before
breakfast, then returned and prepared his frugal
meal, ate sparingly, set his room in order and started
for his day’s work.</p>

<p class='c009'>One morning he arose from a very restless bed,
much earlier than usual, dressed himself and went
down the four flights of stairs to the ground floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>None of his fellow lodgers were yet stirring.</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened the front door and looked out.</p>

<p class='c009'>The street was as quiet as a churchyard. The sky
was just beginning to grow faintly light.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt closed the door behind him, and went
down the steps.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he reached the sidewalk he heard a low moan
and sob.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stopped in surprise to listen and look up and
down the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he could see no one.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moan and sob were repeated so near him that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>as there was no one in sight, it seemed weird, ghostly,
supernatural.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked all around the doorstep, but still saw
nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moan and sob were reiterated with the tearful
wail:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, why don’t she come? Why don’t she come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, at length, he was able to locate the voice. It
came from under the stoop.</p>

<p class='c009'>He bent down and looked there. And first he smelt,
and then he saw a little creature wrapped up in a
noisome rag or shawl, he could not tell which, and
she was moaning, and sobbing, and crying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t she come? Oh, why don’t she come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bent lower, and inquired, gently:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter, little one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know—I don’t know why she don’t
come back!” sobbed the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who do you mean?” inquired Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! she—she—she!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know. She was a ragged woman, and
smelt awful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did she do to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she took off my nice clothes, but I reckon they
were wet, and she wrapped me up in this nasty shawl,
and she left me here and said she would come back
and carry me to Lady. But she never came, and I
am so chilly, and so hungry, and so sick at my stomach
with the smell of this shawl. I am almost dead.
Oh, dear me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come out here, little girl, and let me see you,”
said Harcourt, kindly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The child seemed perfectly fearless. All her horrible
experiences had not had the power to make a coward
of her.</p>

<p class='c009'>She crawled out, tottered to her feet, and stood
before him—a little creature clothed only in an old,
ragged, foul shawl, reaching from her shoulders to
her knees, leaving exposed to view the fair head and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>neck, and the delicate ankles and feet of a beautiful
girl child.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked something like a small, old-fashioned
chimney sweep, wrapped in his sooty, little blanket,
except for the loveliness of her fair face and hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Foul play!” exclaimed Harcourt, as he took in the
whole incongruous picture at a glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How long have you been lying under that stoop,
poor child?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I don’t know. I went to sleep. I just woke
up a little while ago. Oh, sir, please do take me to
Lady,” pleaded the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is Lady, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she is Lady, you know, Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what is her name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—don’t—think—I—quite—know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what do other people call her? Everyone
does not call her Lady, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—nobody but me. I call her Lady. But the
black people do call her ‘young mist’ess,’ and Mr. Merritt
and Dr. Shaw call her ‘Roma, my dear’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt started.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Roma?’—‘Dr. Shaw?’—‘Mr. Merritt?’ What does
all this mean?” he muttered to himself in strong agitation.
Then:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where does this lady live, my child?” he asked, in
a shaking voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! at Goblin Hall. Such a lovely place! Oh,
sir, please—oh! please do take me home to my own
dear Lady!” pleaded the child, putting her little,
white hands together and looking up in his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes, you shall be restored to your Lady,” he
said. “This is very strange. I cannot comprehend
it at all. But I know that I must succor this little
one,” he thought, as he lifted the unresisting child to
his shoulder and carried her up the four flights of
stairs to his room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII<br> <span class='c007'>WILL HARCOURT’S WAIF</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was growing lighter. A bright dawn, shining
over the bay and into the back windows, lighted up
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt laid the child down on his white bed,
shrinking involuntarily from the offensiveness of the
foul rag that wrapped her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she talks of Roma, and Mr. Merritt, and Dr.
Shaw! It is very strange. I cannot comprehend it
all. But I will appeal to Annie. Annie will be able
to learn more from her than I could,” he said to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, please, sir, will you give me something to
eat?” asked the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear. Are you so very hungry?” kindly inquired
Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! so hungry—so very hungry! I never was so
hungry in all my life before. I am all sunk in, and my
stomach has all gone to my backbone—it has, indeed,
though you mayn’t believe it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would you like to have, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bread and butter, with sugar on it,” promptly
replied the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt went to his corner cupboard and brought
out a pitcher of milk and a loaf of bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>He cut a slice, spread it with butter, then with
sugar, and placed it on a plate; then filled a cup with
milk, and took the repast to his little guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>She sat up on the side of the bed to eat it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When did you leave your lady?” he inquired, as
he seated himself on a chair near her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I don’t know. I—I—I——No! it’s no use—I
don’t know. It was—was—ever so long ago,” sighed
the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you lost?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I lost myself. I went out to try to find
Lady; and she found me.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Lady found you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no; of course not! If Lady had found me I
shouldn’t be here, looking this way,” said the elf,
rather indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then who found you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The nasty old woman, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! And what then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did ask her the way to Goblin Hall, and she
told me she would go with me and show me the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! And what next did she do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she took hold of my hand and led me a long
way through such nasty streets, and to the nastiest
house you ever saw in all your life. It made me awful
ill all over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what did you do, you poor child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I went dead—stone dead!” said the little guest,
and then she paused in her speech and applied herself
diligently to the “bread and butter with sugar on it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you came to life again,” said Harcourt, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; I came to life again,” said the imp, with
her mouth full of bread and butter with sugar on it.
“I always do. I’m used to it—I mean, I am getting
used to it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Used to what, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Used to going dead and coming to life again. I
know it sounds as if I wasn’t possessed of common
sense to say so, but it is the truth, for all that. I
have been dead several times since I lost Lady,”
added the elf, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean you fainted?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fainted? I don’t know what you are talking about
‘fainted.’ I went dead—stone dead—dead as a doornail!
and I’ve gone dead two or three times, and the
last time I was dead was in that horrid, nasty
house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when you came to life again——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; when I came to life again I was out in
the street, wrapped up in this—phew!—shawl, and
lying on the ragged old woman’s lap, and she sitting
on the cellar door, close by the stoop where you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>found me,” said the child, and then she stopped to
take a draught of milk from the cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so you found that all your nice clothes had
been taken off you, and this ragged shawl wrapped
around you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but, you see, I reckon it rained while I was
dead, and my clothes must have got wet, and that
poor, old, ragged woman took off my wet clothes and
hung ’em to dry, and put her own poor shawl round
me. I do think she had nothing else to wrap me up
in, poor old thing, and it was good in her to do it,
too. But, all the same, I wish she hadn’t; I’d rather
be soaked to the skin than wear anything so nasty—wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I should,” answered the young man, quite
sincerely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s awful, you know—just awful! But one must
have patience. Oh! what will Lady say to me when
she sees me in this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must try to get you a nice suit of clothes to
take you in to Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! will you—will you? That will be so jolly
nice! Thank you ever so much, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did that woman leave you, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, just where you found me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did she say when she left you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t I tell you? She said she was going to ask
a boy to tell her which was the nearest way to get
to the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady’s house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, do you mean Goblin Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Course I do. Everybody knows Lady’s house is
named Goblin Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you think it is anywhere near this place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. I reckon it is. Not among the
houses, though. Among the hills, and woods, and the
trees and flowers. That’s where Lady’s house is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time the elfin child had eaten up all her
“bread and butter with sugar on it,” and had drank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>up all her milk, and seemed satisfied—for the time
being, at least.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt began to prepare his own breakfast. He
heard his neighbor in the next room preparing hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will speak to Annie before I go to work,” he said
to himself, as he went about his task.</p>

<p class='c009'>When his breakfast of coffee, bread, butter and
chops was on the table, he turned to the child, and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, then, would you like to sit up to the table
and have some breakfast with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; please! What you did give me was
awful good, but it only stayed my stomach. I don’t
think I ever got so hungry again so soon after eating
in all my born days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, then,” he said, as he lifted her up, folded the
tattered wrap more closely around her, sat her in a
chair and pushed the chair to the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>He helped the child first.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She must have been half famished,” he said to himself,
as he noticed the avidity with which she consumed
the food placed before her; for he did not
know that she had but recently recovered from a long
and severe illness and had the appetite of a healthy
convalescent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I must leave her in the care of Annie to-day.
Our Annie will be able to get more information out of
her in one hour than I could in a year,” he reflected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before he had finished his meal he heard the
thumper-thumper-thumper-thumper of his neighbor’s
indefatigable sewing machine in full blast.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon, therefore, as he had risen from the table
and put his room in order, and given the child some
old picture papers to look at, he thought he would go
and see Annie.</p>

<p class='c009'>He felt the strongest possible temptation to stay
home that day to investigate the interesting mystery—to
him—of this child picked up in the streets of
New York, who could talk of nothing else, and of no
one else, but Roma, Dr. Shaw and Mr. Merritt, whose
homes were in Western Maryland or in Washington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>City; but he did not yield to that temptation. He had
laid down for himself an iron-cast rule of life, to go
daily to his hard labor, as though, indeed, he were
under prison discipline for penal servitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he resisted the temptation to stay at home, and
resolved to leave the child and the solution of the
problem to his neighbor for this day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he went to her door and knocked and called.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sound of the sewing machine stopped in an
instant, and the pleasant voice of the woman demanded:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what is it, Mr. William? What can I do
for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come here, dear heart, I wish to speak to you at
once,” Harcourt said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie started up and came and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Mr. William?” she inquired again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Annie, I have picked up a wretched child out
of the street—out of the gutter, I might say—under
our very doorstep here,” Harcourt replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A child! A baby?” exclaimed Annie, staring.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes!—No!—that is, a little girl of about five or
six or seven years old. I am no judge of children’s
ages.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lost?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is hard to say. Lost, or dropped, or stolen, I
am not sure which. But robbed of her clothing certainly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, don’t stand there in the hall. Come in here,
Mr. William, and sit down and tell me all about it.
Where is the child?” Annie inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt went into the room, took the chair she
offered, sat down and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The child is in my apartment. I think she must
have been stolen for blackmailing, or other evil purposes,
from a country house away down South in
Maryland, and brought to New York! then ran away
from her abductor and lost herself in this city, was
picked up by a female thief, beguiled into some den,
robbed of her clothing and abandoned in these streets.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>There, that is my theory; but I am not sure it is the
correct one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor little thing! What can I do for her? I will
do anything in the world. Do you want me to take
care of her while you go and inform the police?”
inquired the gentle woman, in a tone of ready sympathy
and helpfulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt hesitated. Then:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never once thought of the police,” he said, slowly.
And, after a thoughtful pause: “No,” he said,
“I do not think I shall trouble the police with this
child’s care; at least not just yet a while. The fact
is, Annie, that I have strong reasons for believing
that this girl is the protégée of a Southern lady
whom I once knew. And I hope to be able to restore
the child to her without the unpleasant publicity
which an application to the police would involve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes?” said his neighbor, interrogatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. But you see there are difficulties. I am not
quite sure of the truth of my theory. The child is,
besides, very young, ignorant, and mentally confused.
She cannot give a clear account of herself, at least
in answer to my own questions; but, then, I am not
used to children, do not know how to question them,
least of all do I know how to cross-examine them.”
Harcourt hesitated, in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you wish me to do, Mr. William? Indeed,
I should be very glad to be of any use at all
in this case. I have so little opportunity of doing
any good,” said the seamstress, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted you—but I am afraid it will take up too
much of your time—to have this little waif in here
with you to-day, while I shall be away to my day’s
work, and to draw from her, as you women know
so well how to do, the whole truth about herself and
her friends, and the manner in which she was separated
from them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will take her in with pleasure. And I will do
my very best by her,” heartily responded the seamstress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Annie. I thank you very much. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>is for the child,” he said, as he drew a two-dollar
note from his pocket and handed it to her. It was the
last money he had, with the exception of some small
silver change, or that he would have until he should
be paid off at the end of the current week.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is this for?” Annie inquired, as she received
the note.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To get something clean to put on the child. She
is clothed in rags foul enough to give her the plague.
Burn them, Annie, and clothe her cleanly, though I
fear that note is absurdly small for the purpose,”
he said, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh,” said Annie, with a laugh, “this will do quite
well. I can get a good calico frock and two changes
of underclothing with this. Of course they won’t be
very fine, but they will be clean and decent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She said nothing about shoes, or stockings, or hat,
nor did Will Harcourt think of them. But Annie had
already planned to supply these necessaries by breaking
a five-dollar gold piece, which represented the
whole of the poor sewing woman’s savings for the
proverbial “rainy day” that the poor and thrifty expect
and try to provide for. Annie thought that the
“rain” was now falling on the forlorn child, and that
the money would, after all, go to its legitimate use.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the end of the week I shall be able to give
more,” added Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Mr. William. And now you may bring
the little girl in to me, or let me go to her, whichever
you please,” said the seamstress, cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, if you are willing, I will take you in to her.
You can make her acquaintance and win her confidence,
and then invite her into your room. Would
not that be the best way of dealing with this poor
baby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course it would,” Annie answered, with a
laugh. “She would be less shy of me if I were to go
to her first. And you said you did not know anything
about children. Oh, Mr. William! I believe you
know all about them. I believe you have been elder
brother to a long line of baby girls and boys, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>young uncle to a numerous tribe of little nieces and
nephews.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, Annie,” said poor Will Harcourt, with a
profound sigh, given to the memory of his brave
brothers and fair sisters who had left the earth in
the early bloom of youth. “But come, now,” he said.
“I will take you in to our little waif.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The seamstress arose to accompany him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope,” he said, “that she will not be much
trouble to you or hindrance to your work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no,” Annie answered, cheerfully. “I do not
think she need be. And, besides, Mr. William, what if
she should? I have so very little to trouble me, or
to interrupt my work, in comparison to the trials and
hindrances of other women in my line of life, that
when a real duty comes to me I ought to jump at it,
so to speak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The end of this little speech brought them into Harcourt’s
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>They found the child standing at the back window,
gazing out over the roofs of houses and stacks of
chimneys, to the distant sea. She was, of course,
still draped in the dreadful shawl which hung about
her as before, like the sooty blanket of some small,
old-fashioned chimney sweep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! what an object! Poor child!” whispered Annie.
“And how pretty,” she added, as the child turned
around and faced her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little one,” said Harcourt, “I have brought you a
very kind, good friend, who will be a mother to you,
until we can find your lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The waif looked and “took stock” of the woman,
and then solemnly expressed her approval.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I like her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will get you some clean clothes to wear,”
added Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And let me have a bath first?” inquired the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed!” Annie exclaimed, breaking into the
conversation, “that will be the very first thing I will
do for you, and right away, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, thank you, ma’am; thank you ever so much! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>like you ever so much, too. I think—yes, I am quite
sure you are possessed of common sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie looked surprised, and then laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='c009'>The child was rather disconcerted, and hastened to
say, in explanation:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, I only meant that you knew I could not
go back to Lady in this trim, and I could not put on
clean clothes without taking a bath first after this,”
she added, taking up the end of her drapery with a
grimace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you couldn’t,” assented Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I did, I don’t know what Lady would think of
me. Or even Ducky Darling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, my little girl, will you stay here with
this good friend, Mrs. Moss, while I go uptown?”
inquired the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you come back—faithful—and take me to
Lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear child, I shall have to find out where your
lady is first. But don’t you be afraid. I know how
to find her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She lives in Goblin Hall. But, of course, she may
be on a visit, or she may be away hunting all about
for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I will inquire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, now, will you really? this very, very day??”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, I will, my dear. Indeed, I will, my dear,
this very day. Now, good-by, until I see you again,”
he added, stooping and kissing her on the forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurry off, Mr. William; I will take care of the
little girl,” said Annie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Harcourt to himself, as he left the
house, “if I should be an hour late I should be
‘docked’ half a day. But that dear, good woman, she
will lose her whole day’s work, I fear. But, after all,
she will like it,” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Annie did not lose her whole day’s work.</p>

<p class='c009'>She led the child into her own room, prepared a
warm bath in a large washtub, put her into it, gave
her a sponge and a bit of soap, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, play about in that, like a little duck in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>pond, to your heart’s content, while I go and throw
this tangle of fever away,” she said, as she left the
child splashing in the water, took the tongs and
picked up the shawl with them, carried it into Harcourt’s
room, and threw it out of the back window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had no means of burning such a thing in my
small stove. But I am afraid it will become the
treasure-trove of some other ragpicker, and so fulfill
its destiny of a pestilence breeder,” she said, with
a sigh, as she closed the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she returned she found the child still luxuriating
in the warm bath.</p>

<p class='c009'>She rolled up her sleeves and knelt down by her
side, rubbed the little creature down, admiring a form
as beautiful as one of Raphael’s cherubs, took her
out of the tub, wiped her dry, and laid her between
the fresh sheets of her—Annie’s—white bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now that you are so sweet, and clean, and comfortable,
I hope you will not mind staying here by
yourself while I go out to buy some clothes to put
on you. It is only a little way I shall have to go, and
I will not be gone long,” said Annie, as she smoothed
the counterpane over the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, thank you, ma’am, I shall not mind staying
alone, for, you must know, I really am possessed
of common sense,” said the elf, with impressive
gravity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I decidedly think that you are. But, I forgot, I
shall have to get the measure for your shoes. Put
out your foot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The child obeyed. Annie got a bit of tape from her
workbasket and took the length of the little foot.
Then she put her room in order and went out to purchase,
from the cheap store at the corner, a very
plain and limited outfit for the child—namely, two
changes of cheap, cotton underclothing, a small, flannel
petticoat, a pink calico frock, a white apron, a
straw hat, with one band of blue ribbon around it, a
pair of leather shoes, and two pairs of white cotton
stockings. This purchase took the whole of Harcourt’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>two-dollar note, and a dollar and sixty-five
cents out of Annie’s half-eagle.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she got back to her room she found her
charge sleeping deliciously in the white bed. The
little face was flushed with healthful life, and partly
shaded by the luxuriant tangles of the golden brown
hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a lovely possession a child is,” smiled and
sighed the childless widow. “How I wish she was
mine!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She gazed at the pretty picture, but forbore to
disturb the sweet sleeper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, remembering that she could not lose time in
this way, she went to her sewing machine, pushed
it silently to the furthest part of the room from the
bed, so that its sound should not wake the child, sat
down and went to work, and worked hard at it for
three or four hours before the sleeper moved.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII<br> <span class='c007'>A TRANSFORMATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder now what place this is, and what that
thumper-bumpering is, too,” were the words that
greeted the seamstress at last, and informed her that
her charge was awake.</p>

<p class='c009'>She instantly arose and crossed the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you know, darling—don’t you remember?”
she inquired, bending over the child, who, flushed and
smiling, pushed her tangled curls away from her dark
eyes, and looked at her friend and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! I do remember now. Oh, how good you
are to me! And the gentleman, too. Has he come
back?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet, dear. It is not time for him to come yet.
But you must not be afraid. Mr. William will be sure
to keep his word and hunt up your friends,” said
Annie.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“Oh, I know he will! If I didn’t believe in you and
him, I should not be possessed of common sense,” said
the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear, will you get up and let me dress
you? Or would you rather lie here a little longer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! thank you, ma’am, I would like to get up. But
you needn’t trouble about dressing me. I always
dress myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you do? That is quite right. Now, then, here
is your suit of clothes from head to foot,” said Annie,
placing the pile on a chair beside the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the child was dressing, the woman made up
the bed. Both processes were finished about the
same time.</p>

<p class='c009'>The imp looked very clean and nice in her bright
pink frock, white apron, and stockings, and shining
black shoes, and she was regarding herself with great
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your clothes are not as good as the ragpicker
stole from you, I reckon,” said Annie, almost apologetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but I like them better. They are so bright
and pretty! And, then, I shan’t be afraid to soil them.
They can go in the washtub and be washed, you know.
I always like to wear frocks that can go in the washtub
and be washed, you know. Don’t you? One can
keep so clean then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” Annie answered, half laughing, half wondering
at the strange child before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the poor needlewoman’s dinner hour, so she
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear, amuse yourself any way you please—looking
out of the window, or taking up and looking
at anything you like in the room, while I get
dinner for us two, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here,” said the little girl, “I don’t want to
do that. I want to do something to help you. I do
like to do something real useful, only people won’t let
me half the time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what can you do, you solemn, responsible
midget?” inquired the needlewoman.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“You are making fun; but I am in earnest, and I
can do many things. I can piece crazy quilts, as they
call them; but, oh, I tell you they are not crazy at all,
but just the most sensible things in the whole world;
for they use up every bit of the scraps without wasting
a thread of any. Scraps that you couldn’t use for
anything else. Oh, I tell you what! the woman that
first thought of that sort of a quilt was possessed
of common sense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I quite agree with you, my dear, but I am not
making a quilt, and have no quilt pieces,” said Annie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, if you have got any buttons to sew on
anything, or any strings to run in anything else, I
can do that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well,” said Annie, who was too wise a woman
to discourage any child’s desire to do useful work,
however futile the attempt might prove to be—“Very
well, you are an industrious little girl, I think, and
I will give you something to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” said the small sage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a minute,” added Annie, as she caught up
her hat and left the room. She passed downstairs and
out of the house to that convenient corner shop,
where she invested one cent in the tiniest nickel-plated
thimble she could find.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must have a little girl staying with you, Mrs.
Moss,” said the saleswoman of whom Annie had
bought the clothing that morning, and who, by the
way, was a tenant in the same house with the seamstress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A relation?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; only a visitor. I am taking care of her a
few days. Good-morning—though it is noon now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Annie re-entered her room she tried the
thimble on the child’s finger, and found it fit. Then
she took up a calico sack, from a pile that she was
at work upon—just such a sack as the cheap stores
sell for twenty cents apiece.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here,” she said, “the buttonholes are worked, you
see, and I have marked for the buttons. Now you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>may try to sew them on. Here is the card of buttons.
Now let us see what you can do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The child sat down on a little cricket and went
solemnly to work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie began to prepare their frugal midday meal
of coffee, bread, butter and stewed apples. By the
time it was on the table the child got up and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have sewed all the buttons—six of ’em—on this
sack. Will you look and see if you like ’em, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie took the garment the child held out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is very well done,” she said, after examining the
work; and she thought: “It is better done than I
could afford to do it at five cents a sack. Customers
complain that our buttons drop off, but if they knew
how little we get for our work!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hera showed me how to sew buttons on. I used
to help her, too. I used to sew her strings together
for her rag carpet. That is another sensible thing.
Rag carpets use up all the rags and strings, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Annie. “Now come and sit up to the
table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The child obeyed and seated herself opposite to
her hostess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not used to this sort of a poor dinner,”
said the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I think it is just a lovely dinner! I am so
fond of stewed apples, especially with plenty of sugar
in them,” said the little guest, very sincerely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall certainly have as much sugar as you
like on your apples,” replied Annie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, ma’am. How good you are to me!”
said the child, as she received from her hostess a
liberal supply of bread, butter and stewed apples,
flanked by the sugar bowl, from which she was told
to help herself to as much as she wished. “This
is cozy and comfortable, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When dinner was over and the dishes washed, and
the room set in order, Annie went and brought from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Harcourt’s apartment a bundle of old illustrated papers,
which she offered to the child, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can get some amusement out of these while
I go on with my work, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I could, but I don’t want to. I would
rather sew the buttons on the sacks. Now, you just
look at that one and see how well I did it. I didn’t
draw the threads too tight because that would pucker
the places, but I did sew them on strong, and fasten
my ends tight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did the work very well, indeed, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hera showed me how, and she took pains to teach
me, and I took pains to learn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is Hera, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ducky Darling’s mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Annie, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the shrewd child understood at a glance that
she had not been sufficiently explicit, so she added:
“Hera is Lady’s poultry woman, and takes care of
the chickens, and ducks, and the geese, and turkeys,
and Ducky Darling is her little girl, and my little
playmate. Dear Ducky Darling! You would love
her so much if you knew her. She is so sweet. Now
give me some more sacks and buttons, and I will go
to work,” said the small old lady, with an air of confidence
and responsibility.</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie gave her the materials, and then sat down
to her machine and began to ply it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The noise, as well as the occupation, forbade all
conversation, and the woman and child worked on
in silence for three or four hours, until Annie had
finished the job of making the two dozen sacks upon
which she was engaged.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she stopped her machine, covered it, gathered
up her pile of sacks, and drew her chair near the
stool of the child. Here she began to draw out the
basting threads, and fasten loose ends, and put on
all those little finishing touches that must be done
by hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>And while she did this she began to question her
little guest, with so much tact as well as tenderness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>that in the course of an hour or a little more time she
drew from the confiding child as much of the story
of her short life as that child understood and remembered.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it grew too dark to work any longer, Annie
folded up the sacks, which were by that time completely
finished, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you stay here while I go and take these
things to the store at the corner. You see, I work
for that same store where I bought your clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do you? I’m real glad it is so near. And I
will help you all I can. Say! I have been some little
tiny bit of use, haven’t I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, you have, my dear,” Annie answered, as
she left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The child, pleased at this warm acknowledgment
of her services, looked around the room to see what
more she could do to help her friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>She saw threads and fluff scattered about the carpet,
and she stooped down and gathered them up and
put them in the stove.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she looked around again for “new worlds” of
usefulness “to conquer,” and she saw Annie’s workbasket
on the table in some disorder.</p>

<p class='c009'>She took it and sat down with it on her lap and began
to wind up the spools of cotton, roll up the
rounds of tape, and so on.</p>

<p class='c009'>While she was still intent on this little labor of
love her friend re-entered the room, and seeing how
she was engaged, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you little Busy Bee, what are you doing
now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Settling up your workbasket, ma’am, for it wanted
it badly. And now I have finished it. But my name
is not Busy Bee; it is Owlet,” solemnly replied the
child, as she replaced the basket on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know—you told me so; Owlet and also Catherine.
Now which would you rather I should call you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Owlet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, Miss Owlet——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” interrupted the elf. “Not ‘Miss.’ Whoever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>heard of ‘Miss’ Owlet? Plain Owlet. Tom used to
call me Miss Catherine; but that was something else.
Tom was the little colored gentleman who waited on
us when we lived in the city, in the lovely rooms with
Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, then, Miss Catherine——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—Owlet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, Owlet—I think we will get tea. And
by that time, Mr. William will be home,” said the
seamstress, as she lighted her kerosene lamp, stood
it on the mantelpiece, took her kettle and went to the
water spigot to fill it.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she had done this and was returning along
the passage she met Harcourt at the top of the
stairs, with a small paper bag in his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. William,” she said, “I want you, if you
please, to come and take tea with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Us,’ Annie? ‘Us’ has a very pleasant sound.
Yes, I will, thank you. And here are some cutlets
I bought to cook for the child. Will you take them
to add to our tea?” he asked, putting the paper bag
in her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, thank you, Mr. William; this will come in very
well,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is the little one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, bless you! splendid! I have got all her little
story from her, as well as a smart child of her age
could give it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed! What——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, wait! The story is too long to be told here
at the top of the stairs with the tea kettle in my
hand. Wait until after we have had our tea and I
have put the child to bed; then I will tell you all
about it. Her pet name is Owlet. She likes to be
called by it. That is all you need to know just yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right, Annie. I will go into my room and
brush myself up a little, and then join you and the
child,” he said, as he passed into his own apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. William has come, dear. He has just gone
to his room to wash and change his clothes, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>he will come and take tea with us,” said Annie, as
she re-entered her own room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, has he? And did he ask about Lady?” eagerly
demanded Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course he did. Didn’t he promise that he
would?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then he did; you may be quite sure; and he
will tell you all about it when he comes in. And now,
what are you trying to do, little Goody Two Shoes?”
demanded the seamstress, seeing that the child had
taken a white cloth from the cupboard and was pushing
it over the top of the table, which her chin just
reached.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what you mean by Goody Two Shoes,
but I am going to set the table for tea. I can do it
as well as anybody. Now, don’t stop me. See!” she
said, as she pushed the linen as far over the board
as she could make it go, and then ran around and
deftly pulled it straight and even.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see you can do it nicely. Go on, then, little
Bopeep,” said Annie, with a smile of approval, as
she began to cook the cutlets, furtively watching the
child with some uneasiness for the safety of her
crockery.</p>

<p class='c009'>She soon saw that she had no reason to fear, for
Owlet was so excessively and even ludicrously careful
in handling cups and saucers, etc., that she finished
her task without the slightest accident.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time the tea was ready Harcourt rapped at
the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet flew to open it before Annie could say “Come
in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, have you found Lady?” she eagerly demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt entered, sat down, took the child on his
knees and answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have sent a telegram to that Mr. Merritt you
mentioned. Do you know what a telegram is?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet looked at him in grave disapprobation of his
impertinence in asking a question that implied her
ignorance of such a well-known thing.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“Why, of course I do. Lady used to send lots of
them. They go like a flash of lightning and come back
like another flash of lightning. Puck used to take
’em when he went to the post office, and fetch ’em
back when he came home. Oh, I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think ‘what you do not know is not worth knowing,’
as the saying is,” observed Annie, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you get an answer? Oh, tell me quick!” said
Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No answer yet; but I am expecting one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now come and sit down to tea, both of you,” Annie
directed, as she placed chairs at the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know, as soon as ever Mr. Merritt gets the
message, he will hurry right off and tell Lady, and
she will come right away and fetch me home,” Owlet
declared, as her friend lifted her up and seated her
beside himself at the board.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it very likely,” he replied, as he helped
the child to a cutlet, while their hostess was pouring
out their tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after they had finished the evening meal
Owlet’s eyes began to wink and her head to nod.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt noticed the symptoms of sleepiness, and
so he got up and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will bid you good-night,” and stooped and kissed
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, sir. And, oh, if Lady comes for me
after I have gone to sleep, will you please wake me
up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, if she should come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have been very good to me, sir. Lady will
thank you, oh, ever so much. And so will Ducky
Darling, in her heart, for she don’t know how to talk
much, poor little thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Harcourt had left the room the self-reliant
child insisted on undressing herself, and was soon
in bed and asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Annie tidied up her room and went and
knocked at Harcourt’s door.</p>

<p class='c009'>He came out and followed her to her own room.</p>

<p class='c009'>They took seats at the front window.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“You must have some inkling of the little girl’s
history yourself, Mr. William,” Annie began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you think so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You knew where to send a telegram.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I knew that much, for the child chanced to
mention some names of persons and places once familiar
to me. Acting on that, I telegraphed Lawyer
Merritt. I have had no answer from him yet. If I
do not get one to-night, I shall telegraph Dr. Shaw
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is Dr. Shaw?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rector of Goeberlin parish, in which Goblin Hall
is situated. And Goblin Hall, as the child told you,
is her ‘Lady’s house,’ where that lady lives a part of
every year.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes. I see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, pray, tell me all that you have learned from
the child of herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie then told the story as Owlet told her, in
answer to leading questions. It need not be repeated
her, even in epitome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So this little foundling of ours is the orphan of
a poor widow who died in an apartment house in
Washington, and the adopted daughter of the mistress
of Goblin Hall, from which she was abducted.
This is the gist of the whole story,” said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but why should she have been stolen from
her benefactress? Who could have had any interest
in the abduction of an orphan child living on charity?”
Annie questioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one but the very man who carried her off. He
alone was interested,” Harcourt answered, grimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why should he, whoever he was, have been
interested in taking off a destitute orphan adopted by
a benevolent lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt paused for a moment to reflect before
answering. He had “read between the lines” of the
story. He knew more of it than Annie had heard, or
Owlet had understood, yet he could not tell his own
or Roma’s terrible story even to this good woman,
nor could he give her any distinct or satisfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>answer to her question without at least alluding to
that “Deed Without a Name.” So he answered,
vaguely:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some mercenary, selfish or blackmailing motive,
no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just at this moment a knock was heard at the door
of Harcourt’s room. He left Annie, and saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That may be the telegram,” went out into the
passage to see.</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie heard him in low-toned talk with some one
there, who presently left him and went downstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Harcourt returned, looking very much puzzled,
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a telegram from Mr. Merritt. I will read it
to you,” he said; and he read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>City Hall, Washington, D. C.</span>, May 1, 187—.</div>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>To Mr. William Williams</span>, 110 Drouse Street,

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Amos Merritt.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“This is strange, and passing strange, Annie, is it
not?” inquired the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is indeed. I do not understand it in the least,”
sighed the seamstress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must wait for the letter of explanation, it
seems. That will clear up the case, I hope,” concluded
Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment there was another knock at Harcourt’s
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder what that is. It can’t be another telegram,”
he said, with a slight smile, as he again got up
and went out in the passage.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was another telegram, for in a few moments
Harcourt returned to the seamstress’ room with a
face so white and a frame so shaken that she started
up in a fright, and hurriedly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the Lord’s sake, Mr. William, what is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>matter? What has happened? Have you received
bad news?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Annie, very bad news. The very worst that
could have come to me. I have received this telegram,
summoning me immediately to my mother’s sick bed.
Ah! her deathbed, I have every reason to fear,” said
the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he did not read this telegram to her, as he had
read the first because this one was written and
directed as follows to the address he had left with the
Wynthrops:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c002'>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Margaret Wynthrop.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>No, he could not read that telegram to Annie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. William, I am so very sorry. When shall
you start?” she inquired, full of interest and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The last train for to-night would be gone before I
could reach Jersey City. By the first train to-morrow
I must leave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the child, Mr. William? You will leave her
with me, I hope. I will take good care of her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear soul. I must take her with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Mr. William, she would embarrass you, going
on such a journey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I might have an opportunity of restoring her to
her friends. In any case, dear heart, I feel a certain
responsibility connected with that child which I cannot
explain or even understand. I must take her
with me and watch for an opportunity of restoring
her to her friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And about that letter, Mr. William?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If one should come, forward it to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but please write out the address in full, for I
am the worst hand in the world to remember names
and places.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Harcourt took a lead pencil from his pocket, found
a piece of paper in his table drawer, and wrote the
following address: Mr. W. Williams, care of Mr. W.
Harcourt, Logwood, Alleghany County, Maryland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Annie,” he said, as he gave her the slip of
paper, “I will not keep you up any longer. Good-night!
God bless you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He went into his own room, but did not light his
lamp or retire to bed. He dropped into his chair,
buried his face in his hands, and murmured:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has come! It has come! The awful crisis of
my life has come at last!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV<br> <span class='c007'>HE GOES TO HIS DOOM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Harcourt did not go to bed that night. He sat by
the back window, with his head bowed upon his hands,
or he rose and walked up and down the door of his
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Until midnight the sound of his neighbor’s sewing
machine kept him company. Then it ceased. He
threw himself for the last time in his chair, and sat
with his elbow on the window sill, his forehead on
his fingers, trying to nerve his soul for the ordeal in
store for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the earliest streaks of dawn appeared in the
east he got up, bathed his face, and prepared to set
out for Adler’s rooms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt was without a dollar, and it was necessary
to borrow money to pay his way to Virginia.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he went into the hall he heard Annie stirring
about in her apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went and rapped at her door.</p>

<p class='c009'>She quickly opened it, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, Mr. William. I knew it was you.
I heard you come out of your own room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Annie; I must go to see Adler before starting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>on my journey. I just stopped to ask you if you
would be so good as to prepare the child to accompany
me. You can tell her that I am going to take
her to Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Mr. William; but suppose Lady won’t have
her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot suppose anything of the sort in the case
of this lady and child; but even in the improbable
event you suggest I should be able to place the little
one in good hands,” said Harcourt, thinking of the
benevolent and prosperous Wynthrops, as he turned
to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. William!” said Annie, calling him back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Annie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have no call to get anything or to worry
over the fire, just as you are going on a long journey.
I will have breakfast ready by the time you come back
from Adler’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Annie!” he said, with a deprecating sigh, “how
you do invite me to impose on you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Mr. William, you know I’m a lone widow,
growing old, without even an ‘only son of his mother’
to comfort me, unless it’s you, and I feel like a mother
to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Since ever I have known you, Annie, you have
been like—a dear, elder sister; but lately you have
done too much for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! no! Mr. William. And as for this, why, it’s
nothing. Besides, you wouldn’t have time to go to
Adler’s and come back and cook your breakfast and
catch your train.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed, I should not, Annie; so now I must
thank you and hurry away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He ran downstairs, out of the house, and down the
street to the avenue, where he hailed a car and jumped
on board.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ten minutes’ ride brought him to the corner of the
street on which Adler lived.</p>

<p class='c009'>He jumped off the car and ran up the sidewalk until
he reached his friend’s home.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>It was still so early that the family had just risen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wife was getting breakfast ready.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are our morning star, Mr. William. You always
shine before sunrise,” said Mrs. Adler, laughing
at her own fancy, as she wiped her fingers and shook
hands with him; but the next instant she saw his woebegone
face, and hastened to exclaim:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something has happened to you, Mr. William!
What is it? Can Adler or I do anything for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are right, my friend. I have had very bad
news. My mother is ill, perhaps dying. I am called
to her bedside,” Harcourt replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I am so sorry,” said the sympathetic woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Adler, can I speak to you a moment?” he inquired
of the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. Mr. William. Come, and we will take a
walk on the pavement while the mother is getting
breakfast,” said the man, leading the way out.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they paced up and down before the house Harcourt
told his friend of his trouble, and ended by
saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This evening we shall all be paid off our semimonthly
wages, but as I shall not be at work to-day
the contractor will only owe me for eleven days’ work.
That will be sixteen dollars and fifty cents. Now,
Adler, if you can conveniently advance me that money
I will give you an order to receive my wages, due
to-night, and I shall be more than grateful to you
for a very great accommodation. It is to pay the
expenses of my journey south, for I have not a dollar.
Nothing but the extreme illness of my mother would
induce me to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Sir. William, not another word, or you’ll hurt
my feelings!” exclaimed Adler, interrupting the
speaker. “I owe you every cent I have in the world.
I owe you life itself. Ever since that night when you
plucked me out of the very jaws of death and hell
I have had good luck. I have had steady work, and
never lost a day, or a half day. Nor has the wife, nor
any of the kids, had an hour of illness. That was the
turning point of my luck, Mr. William, and it was you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>under Providence, that turned it. I have lived well
and saved up forty-seven dollars, and every single
dollar of it is heartily at your service,” he added
cordially, catching and clasping the hand of his
friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you! thank you!” warmly exclaimed Harcourt.
“Thank you! But the amount that may be
covered by the wages due me will be amply sufficient
for my necessities. Nor would it be honest in me to
borrow more, for heaven only knows whether I should
ever be able to repay you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, hush! hush! You hurt my feelings! You do,
indeed! Come in, now, and I will get the ammunition
for the battle of life,” said Adler.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had been walking back toward the house, and
had now reached the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>They entered the room where the wife had the
breakfast ready.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your husband will tell you all about it, Mrs. Adler,”
said Harcourt in answer to her anxious, questioning
looks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adler went into an inner room, but soon returned
with a sealed envelope, which he silently put in the
hand of his friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt pressed his hand in mute thanks, and then—declining
their hospitable invitation to join their
morning meal, on the plea that he had to hasten back
to his lodgings with all speed, to pack his valise and
catch his train—took leave of the kind family, ran
to the corner of the street, boarded a passing car, and
rode home.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found breakfast waiting on Annie’s stove, ready
to be put on the table, and little Owlet in the seventh
heaven of delight at the prospect of being taken immediately
home to Lady by Mr. William.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt spent but little time over his repast and
then went to his room to pack his bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking around, and remembering that he should
never return to that room, and that its simple furniture
might be worth something to his kind neighbor,
he called her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>She came to him promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>He could not find it in his heart to sadden her by
telling her he should never come back again, so, when,
after waiting a minute for him to tell her why he
had called her, she inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Mr. William? What can I do for you?”
He answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know, Annie, that our landlord’s prudent
agent always makes us pay the month’s rent in advance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Mr. William; and I think it is just as well,
for it’s off our minds then, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Well, I have paid my month’s rent in advance,
as usual. I will leave you the receipt for the
rent, Annie. There are three weeks yet to run. If I
should not return at the end of that time you may give
up my room, Annie, and take possession of my furniture.
I give it all to you. In the meantime, dear soul,
use this room and all there is in it as if it were your
own. The weather will soon be warm, and from my
room here you will get the sea breeze.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. William, you make my heart ache! Why
do you talk so? You are not going to die! You are
young and healthy! You will come back all right!”
said Annie, with her eyes swimming in tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Annie,” he said, forcing a smile, “there are other
changes besides death, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is true,” she murmured. “You might come
into a fortune, or you might get married, or you might
do both. But you will write and tell me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I will write and tell you; but I want you
to know now that after I am gone you are to use this
room and furniture as your own to the end of the
month, and then, if I do not return, take possession
of the furniture,” concluded Harcourt, feeling a secret
satisfaction in the knowledge that, whatever should
happen to him in the near future, this good woman
and sympathetic friend would never know the tragedy
of his life—would never recognize in William Harcourt,
the convict, William Williams, the young workman.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“If anything prevents your coming back, Mr. William,
I hope it will be a wife and a fortune,” said
Annie as she left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt locked his valise, took a last look around
his apartment, and followed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he re-entered Annie’s room he found Owlet
dressed for her journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Annie had invested another dollar of her
scanty savings for the child’s benefit.</p>

<p class='c009'>She knew that it would not be proper to start the
child on a railway journey with a gentleman—and
Annie had never been misled into any mistake as to
“Mr. William’s” real social position—in a pink calico
frock and a white apron, and so she extinguished
Owlet’s fiery plumage under a little brown coat, more
suitable to a little bird of wisdom, and for which she
had paid sixty cents at that convenient corner store
for which she worked. She put a brown ribbon of
the same shade of the coat on the little straw hat,
in place of the blue band, put a pair of ten-cent brown
gloves on the tiny hands, and a five-cent handkerchief
in the little pocket, with—which was an injudicious
put—a penny roll of peppermint lozenges. Last of
all, she folded up a paper of sandwiches for luncheon,
and gave them to Owlet, charging her to hand them
over to Mr. William when they should have taken
their seats in the car.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now you are all equipped for your travels, little
mite, and may the Lord have you in his care,”
said Annie, just as Harcourt entered the room, valise
in hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not notice Owlet’s traveling dress, much
less compute its cost, or ask himself where the cash
had come from that paid for it. He was as ignorant
of all such knowledge as the child was. And Owlet
herself must have been surprised had she suddenly
discovered how little of common sense was possessed
either by herself or her protector on this subject.
Childlike, she took all this for granted. Harcourt’s
mind was burdened by heavier matters.</p>

<p class='c009'>He bade good-by to Annie with emotion that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>could not understand. She did not know, as he did,
that this was probably, almost certainly, their final
parting.</p>

<p class='c009'>And in this he had still only the one poor consolation—that
when she should read in the newspapers
of the conscience-stricken criminal who had given
himself up to justice she would never think of connecting
him with her sometime neighbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this sad leave taking Harcourt led his little
protégé out of the house and to the foot of Cortlandt
Street, which was not far off. They boarded the ferryboat
as it was about to start.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you remember ever having crossed this water
before?” inquired Harcourt as the boat steamed away
from the pier.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” Owlet answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet you must have crossed this water when you
came to this city.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Must I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, I must have crossed it while I was
dead. I went dead several times while—while I was
with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Him? Who?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man who took me away from Lady and Ducky
Darling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who was that man, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know; but Lady wouldn’t let him come
in, and he wouldn’t go away, and Pompous Pirate set
the dog on him—Tiger, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt knew perfectly well; and if he ever had
had a doubt as to the identity of the child’s abductor
that doubt was set at rest now. He also understood
what Owlet meant by going dead, and by what means
the child stealer had managed to quiet her at intervals
during their journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the boat reached Jersey City, Harcourt, leading
the child with one hand and his valise in the
other, hurried on with the throng to the depot. When
he reached the ticket office and took out and opened
Adler’s sealed envelope, he found, not the sixteen dollars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>and fifty cents he had asked for, but thirty dollars,
in three notes of ten each.</p>

<p class='c009'>“More than half of his six months’ savings,” he
said to himself. “Ah, me! the more I see of Adler
the worse I think of myself. But his money must
not be used—no, indeed, it must not. I must return
it as soon as I get to Washington, and trust to Providence
for future supplies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took tickets for himself and the child and hurried
to the train. In two more minutes they were
seated side by side in the common car, Harcourt next
the window, lest Owlet should endanger her safety
by putting her head out of it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV<br> <span class='c007'>CHARLES CUTTS AGAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The car was not more than half full, but just as it
started Harcourt heard a man come into the seat behind
them, drop down in his place, and deposit a
heavy bag beside him; and next he felt a hand laid
familiarly on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned his head, and was face to face with
Charles Cutts, the Baltimore broker, who was so
fatally mixed up with the tragic drama of his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do? How do you do?” exclaimed the
broker pleasantly, offering his fat hand. “Every time
I see you, do you know, I am reminded of that night
of Yelverton’s death on the Isle of Storms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I need never to be reminded of it,” said poor Harcourt
with a profound sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not so cautious and reticent now as he had
been in his previous encounter with Cutts. The time
of his confession was drawing too near to make it
necessary that he should be so. If Cutts—who certainly
knew more of the manner of Yelverton’s death
than any other man, except Harcourt himself—should
feel inclined to denounce him, why, let Cutts do it—if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>he would only wait a few days or hours, until Dorothy
Harcourt should be at rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! you don’t require to be reminded of it, don’t
you? Brooding over it all the time, eh? That’s morbid.
Take my advice, don’t you do it. It is hurting
your health. You are looking very badly, my young
friend. Don’t brood over what can’t be altered now,”
said Cutts, patting him on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot help it. Since you know so much, you
must also——” Harcourt replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I do know so much!—much more than you
dream of, my young friend—much more than I shall
ever breathe to mortal ears, except your own, unless,
indeed, it should be necessary to do so to vindicate
some innocent accused person,” said Cutts, dropping
his voice to a low murmur, which precaution seemed
unnecessary, since there was no one near enough to
hear their conversation except the child, who did not
understand what they were talking about.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not be afraid, Mr. Cutts. No innocent man
shall ever suffer for me, whether you ever open your
lips on the subject or not,” said poor Harcourt in
a husky whisper, speaking now in recognition of the
secret understanding between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the broker stared at him blankly for a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not so sure of that. Look here, young man,
what do you mean? You brood too much on this
matter. How do I know what it will lead to? How
do I know but what you will become insane, and go
and accuse some poor devil or other, whom I shall
have to vindicate by pointing out the real murderer?
Take my advice, and don’t brood, young fellow. It
can do no good. ‘What’s done is done,’ as Lady Macbeth,
that strong-minded woman, wisely remarked to
her very particularly feeble-minded lord and master.
All the brooding in the present and future cannot
alter the past. Say to yourself that you could not
help what happened; and you really could not, you
poor boy! Say to yourself it was kismet—and it was
kismet, William Harcourt. Say that to yourself, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>then dismiss the matter at once and forever from
your mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As if I could!” sighed the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not? The case is closed and forgotten, except
by you and me. The coroner’s jury decided that
Nathan Yelverton committed suicide, and all the
world believed in the truth of that verdict—except
you and me. We know, you and I, that the notorious
sharper and blackleg did not die a suicide. But no
one else on earth, except you and me, know that for
the fact that it is, or even suspect it as a bare possibility,
and I shall never divulge the secret, or breathe
a hint of it to any living creature, except under the
contingency I have mentioned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why do you always speak of it to me? Why,
whenever I happen to meet you anywhere, do you
broach this painful subject?” inquired Harcourt in
a distressed tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why? Because it is a sort of relief to talk of it
to the only man that shares the secret, and—also—because,
whenever I meet you, your looks trouble me.
I see you suffer, and I fancy it might be some relief
to you, also, to speak of this tragedy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not. It is exceedingly distressing to me.
And now, Mr. Cutts, I must entreat you to drop it,
after this, my ultimatum: That as you will only speak
in vindication of some innocent person, I repeat that
no innocent person shall be accused or suffer for me.
Now that we perfectly understand each other, pray
let us say no more about the horror,” said Harcourt,
turning his head away from his persecutor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a child you are! And, by the way, I am
not so perfectly sure that we do understand each
other. I, in point of fact, I am pretty sure that we
do not. But here we are at Newark, where I get off.
Good-by,” said the broker, as the train slowed into
the station, and he took up his bag and left his seat
to get off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt rested his elbows on the window sill,
dropped his head on his hands, and sank into troubled
thought as the train started again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Owlet was anxiously watching him. She had seen
that the stranger had annoyed her friend, although
she had not understood the drift of the conversation;
and now, seeing him so bowed down in sorrow, she
blamed the stranger, and sought to console Harcourt
by the only formula that occurred to her mind:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you mind him,” she said, sniffing with exquisite
childish scorn. “He’s not possessed of common
sense!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt patted her head, in recognition of her
sympathy, and then relapsed into troubled reverie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet, perceiving that her companion was indisposed
for conversation, settled herself in her seat,
drew her roll of peppermint lozenges from her pocket,
and occupied herself with them until the motion of
the cars and the aroma of the peppermint sent her
off into a sleep that lasted until they reached Wilmington.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she was awakened by the train stopping and
the passengers leaving their seats for the railway
restaurant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What shall I bring you for lunch, little girl?” inquired
Harcourt, rousing himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing. Miss Annie gave me this to give to
you,” said the child, handing over the paper parcel
of luncheon that had been intrusted to her. “It is
our dinner,” she added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Annie has been like a sister to me, and a
mother to you, has she not, little girl?” inquired Harcourt
as he opened the parcel, spread a newspaper
over his knees, and divided the sandwiches and apple
pie between himself and his little companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! she has that,” responded Owlet emphatically.
“She is possessed of common sense, and I am going to
ask Lady to invite her to come down and stay at
Goblin Hall—that I am!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you think Lady will comply with your request?”
inquired Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will—what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will do it, when you ask her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, of course she will, when I tell her what a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>dear, good woman Miss Annie is. Lady is possessed
of common sense, you bet. She has invited ever so
many poor people to come to her house this summer.
She has such a great big house, with ever so many
rooms in it, and ever such a great big garden, with
ever so much fruit and flowers in it. She’s got everything
she wants, and plenty of it—eggs and roses and
banty chickens, and potatoes, and strawberries, and
cows, and—and—things, you know—ever so many.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But will Lady be willing to share all these things
with a perfect stranger like Annie Moss?” inquired
Harcourt, solely for the purpose of drawing the child
out to talk of his loved and lost Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Owlet looked at him in solemn disapprobation.
Why should he, or any one, doubt that Lady would
do everything that was kind to everybody, her eyes
seemed to ask. Then she answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course she will! And, of course, Miss Annie
will be no stranger after I have told Lady all about
her; and Lady will be sure to invite her to come to
Goblin Hall. You’ll see. Oh! I think I will ask Lady
to invite you to stay when you take me home to her.
Wouldn’t you like to stay?” inquired Owlet, with sudden
inspiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady is very good to everybody, then?” said the
young man, evading the child’s question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You bet! Why, didn’t I tell you she was possessed
of common sense? But I don’t believe you listen to
one word I say!” Owlet exclaimed in a tone of pique.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I do, indeed. To every word you speak
about Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you don’t. You never answered me when I
asked you if you wouldn’t like to stay at Lady’s house
when you take me home there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon, mistress. I will answer now.
I should, very much, if I could, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you can, if you want to. I will tell Lady
how good you have been to me, and she will have
you stay, I know. And, oh! I think she will like you
very much—I do, indeed. And, oh! I say, Mr. William!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“What now, little girl?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have just thought of it—oh! such a great thing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you and Lady would get married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good heavens!” muttered the young man under
his breath, and he turned quickly and looked out of
the window to conceal the agitation of his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everybody who is possessed of common sense gets
married, you know. And Lady is possessed of more
common sense than anybody I ever saw in this world,”
continued Owlet, paying, in her own estimation, the
highest possible tribute to the character of her benefactress.
“But, you see, there’s nobody down there
for her to marry. There’s only old Dr. Keech, who
pulls people’s teeth out and gives them nasty physic,
and who I do not think is possessed of common sense.
And there’s old Mr. Shaw, who preaches such long
sermons he almost makes me gape the top of my head
off; and there’s Lawyer Merritt, who is good for nothing,
’cept when he is Santa Claus. And, yes, there’s
old, old, old Grandfather Toomie, but he has got one
wife already, and I don’t think she’d like him to marry
Lady. There, Mr. William! Them’s all the men Lady
has to choose from to marry, unless it’s you, you
know, and if you are possessed of common sense you
will marry Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my dear, I am not possessed of common
sense,” said Harcourt in a serio-comic tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, now!” exclaimed Owlet, dropping a piece of
pie she was conveying to her mouth. “I always
thought so myself! I did, indeed! Though, mind you,
I never said so. You said it, not me. I wouldn’t like
to, when you were so good to me; but it’s too true!”
she added, with a profound sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear, it is too true,” Harcourt confessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, never mind. Maybe you was born so, and
can’t help it. But I tell you what you do. You marry
Lady—Lady has got enough for both of you. She’s
got more than anybody I know. Marry Lady! You
know very well that you ought to marry. Everybody
ought to marry. I am going to be married myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“Oh, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed! You bet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I ask the name of the happy man?” inquired
Harcourt, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What happy man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lucky fellow you are going to marry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know yet. But somebody, you may
bet your life on that.” And having expressed this
excellent resolution, Owlet fell to eating her luncheon
with a concentration of attention that precluded the
possibility of further conversation for the present.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt’s appetite had vanished. He could eat
but little, and that little in a merely perfunctory manner,
to keep his physical strength from utterly failing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Passengers returned to their seats. New people
got in. Some strangers took their places immediately
behind Harcourt and his little companion, so that if
either the man or the child had felt inclined to renew
their discourse they could not have carried it on
confidentially. But, in fact, neither wished to talk.
Harcourt was buried in gloomy thought, and Owlet
was heavy with drowsiness, like any other tired young
animal after a hearty meal, so she curled herself up
on her seat and shut her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train soon started again, and rushed onward
toward its southern destination.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rapid motion, with the total absence of conversation,
soon lulled the child to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>The remainder of the journey passed without incident.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVI<br> <span class='c007'>MR. MERRITT’S NEWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was growing late in the afternoon when the train
ran into the Baltimore &#38; Ohio Railroad Depot at
Washington.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt had still two hours to wait before he
could get a train for West Virginia.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>He determined to utilize this time by calling at the
chambers of Mr. Amos Merritt to ascertain from him
the present address of Roma Fronde, the probabilities
of her receiving again the child who had been
stolen from her, or if the lady’s views were changed
in regard to protecting the orphan, what had changed
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>He secured his tickets for Logwood, checked his
valise, because he could not well carry it to the lawyer’s
office, and then took the hand of Owlet and led
her from the building.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, then, where are you going to carry me right
away?” inquired that practical young woman, who
was so largely endowed with common sense, and had
so exalted an appreciation of its value.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going to Mr. Merritt’s office to inquire where
Lady is at present. You remember Mr. Merritt?” inquired
Harcourt as they walked on toward Louisiana
Avenue, for it is needless to say Harcourt could not
afford to hire a carriage, nor indeed was one needed
for so short a distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I should smile! Haven’t I been talking to
you about him? He is one of them old gentlemen
Lady will have to marry if you don’t marry her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear child, do not talk that way,” said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t Lady at Goblin Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not sure that she is there now. She may be
at the Isle of Storms, or she may be here in this
very city.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, if I thought that!” joyfully exclaimed Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you see, it is better to inquire and make sure
of where she is before we do anything else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes. And Mr. Merritt will be certain to know
all about Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we are. This is the place where the old lawyer
hangs out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet looked all the way up the front of the house,
and then turned great round eyes of inquiry to Harcourt’s
face.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>“Oh, I don’t mean himself, but his sign. There it is—‘Amos
Merritt, Attorney-at-Law.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” said the child, as her companion led her
into the house and up the stairs to the second floor,
where Mr. Merritt’s chambers were situated.</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened a door on the right, that led into a large
front room, where a young clerk sat writing at a
desk. There was no one else in this outer office.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Mr. Merritt in?” inquired Harcourt, going up
to the desk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In his private office, yes, sir,” the clerk replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you take my card to him and say that I would
be pleased to see him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” the young man answered, and he took
the bit of pasteboard and carried it into the back
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few minutes he returned and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Merritt will see you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear little girl, will you mind sitting here
for a few minutes, while I go in first to speak to Mr.
Merritt alone?” Harcourt inquired of the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, n—no,” said Owlet reluctantly, “not if you
want me to do it. But you know Mr. Merritt is a
very good friend of mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know, and you shall come in and speak to
him presently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right; go along. I will sit away off here by
the window and look out on the street. I don’t want
to hear your secrets,” said Owlet, with a ludicrous
burlesque of childish dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>At a happier time Harcourt might have smiled at
the little airs of the child, but now he only laid his
hand kindly on her head, and then saying, “I will not
be gone long,” passed into the inner room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lawyer Merritt had risen to receive his unexpected
visitor, and now stood facing the door, drawn up to
his utmost height, with a very severe expression of
countenance, and without a word of welcome on his
lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>Young Harcourt felt chilled and discouraged by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>such a want of welcome, and hastened to say, deprecatingly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Merritt, I should, perhaps, apologize for this
intrusion, but I have come here on business in which
I think one of your fair clients is interested.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then take a seat, sir, and be good enough to let
me know the precise nature of the business which has
procured me the unlooked for honor of this call,” said
the lawyer frigidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, I will not sit,” said Harcourt, flushing
deeply. “What I have to say may be said in a very
few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer bowed, and stood waiting, with one
hand resting upon his desk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You received a telegram yesterday announcing the
discovery of a child lost in the streets of New York,
and ascertained to have been stolen from the custody
of her guardian, Miss Fronde, at Goblin Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did receive such a telegram, sir, and answered
it. May I inquire what you have to do with the
matter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. It was I who found the child, and
through the intervention of a good woman, full of
tact and delicacy, learned as much of the little one’s
story as could be drawn from a creature of her tender
years. I learned, in short, that the little Owlet
was an orphan who had been adopted by Miss Fronde,
between whom and herself there seemed to have been
a strong bond of affection.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir,” said the lawyer in the same icy tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was I who wired you of the discovery of the
lost child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under a false name, then,” said the lawyer scornfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not exactly, but under my own first name,” said
Harcourt patiently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir, I answered your telegram in sufficiently
clear terms, I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but—pray pardon me—your answer came in
a few hours after my dispatch. Did you really have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>time to communicate with Miss Fronde on the subject
before answering my telegram?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I relied upon my own responsibility as her
solicitor, with perfect knowledge of her relations to
the adopted child, as well as of all her other business,
and I considered my course in the matter conclusive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the young man, still very forbearingly,
“and that would have settled the question as to what
should be done with the forsaken orphan, and I should
myself have taken care of her, had not a message
come summoning me immediately to the sick bed of
my dear mother, to whom I am even now en route,
only waiting for the train that will start in less than
two hours for West Virginia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry to hear that Mrs. Harcourt is ill,” said
the lawyer, softened a little by the sorrow and patience
of his young visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, sir. Under such circumstances I really
did not know what to do with the forlorn child, except
to bring her along with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you have really brought her here?” demanded
the lawyer in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I could not do otherwise. The little creature was
and is, wild to return to her benefactress. I thought
possibly, under the circumstances, that Miss Fronde
might reconsider her resolution to have nothing further
to do with the child, and reflect that the orphan’s
abduction was her great misfortune rather than her
fault.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are mistaken. Miss Fronde formed no such
determination. If you recall the terms of my telegram,
you will find that I merely said that Miss
Fronde could not interfere in the case of the child.
And, in fact, sir, she had no right to do so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No right? May I be permitted to ask why she had
no right?” Harcourt inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer dismissed the question with a wave of
his hand and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am by no means sure, however, that since the little
one has been lost, and found again, Miss Fronde
may not be willing, and even well pleased, to receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>her back again. She was certainly very fond of little
Owlet. However, that can be easily ascertained, as
Miss Fronde is now in Washington.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In Washington!” echoed Harcourt, as his heart
bounded and sank at the thought that his loved and
lost Roma was now so close within his reach, yet so
unapproachable—forever unapproachable by him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. She arrived here by the late train from the
West last night. She was on her way when I answered
your telegram, which was the reason why I
could not communicate with her. She is en route for
the Isle of Storms, which she is turning into a sanitorium
for destitute invalids and children. She leaves
to-morrow by the early boat for the Isle. So, if you
feel inclined to try the experiment, you had better
take the child to her this evening. You will find
her at her old quarters, the Wesleyan Flats, in the
northwestern suburbs of the city.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt had not been able to put in a word until
now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” he sighed, “I have not time. My train leaves
at seven, and it is now after six. I dare not miss a
train while my mother lies at the point of death. No—nor
to tell the bitter truth—dare I present myself
to Miss Fronde.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer suddenly looked grave and stern again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt perceived his change of mood, and said,
with a sigh:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel and know in what a dark aspect I must
appear to you, Mr. Merritt, but wait only for a few
days longer and you will know and understand all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mystery is humbug, sir,” said the lawyer roughly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is more than that, in some cases, Mr. Merritt—it
is guilt, remorse and shame,” said the young man,
in a tone of such deep despair that the old lawyer
was startled. “But let that pass for the moment,”
he added. “This child—does Miss Fronde know that
she has been found?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I only saw her last night, when I met her by
appointment, at the depot, and took her to the Wesleyan.
I would not trouble her then with news that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>might have broken her night’s rest. For reasons that
it is not necessary to go into now she thought Owlet
was in proper hands, and was, in a measure, at ease
on her account. If, however, I had told her that the
child had been lost and found in the city of New York
she would have been very much distressed, especially
as she could not have then interfered; but since the
child is here again, and without her agency, she may
receive her; and I am inclined to think she will do
so. I have not seen Miss Fronde to-day, but I have
an engagement to dine with her at the Flats this
evening at half-past seven.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, Mr. Merritt, as it is impossible for me to
approach Miss Fronde, and be the happy medium of
restoring the lost one, will it be too much for me to
ask of you to do this gracious service to the orphan
and her benefactress?” Harcourt pleaded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I will take the child to Miss Fronde.
Where is she?” inquired the lawyer, looking around
as if he expected to find her perched upon some chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the front room. I will go and bring her in, if
you will permit me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. Go, and bring her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harcourt passed into the front room, where he
found the child yawning in a deep leather armchair,
in which her little figure was nearly lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you have been a time! I have almost gaped
the top of my head off!” said Owlet reproachfully, as
soon as she saw him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry. But come, my dear. Mr. Merritt wants
to see you, and take you right away to your Lady,”
said Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, where is she? Where is she?” exclaimed Owlet,
jumping off the chair in great excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not far off. She is back here in the city, and in
that same house where you first met her. You will
see her in time to take tea with her,” he replied as
he led the delighted child into the presence of the
lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello, Miss Catherine! Is that you? You have
had adventures since I saw you last. You will have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>to write your travels, I am thinking. Where did you
come from last?” gayly demanded Mr. Merritt, holding
out his hand to the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>She rushed upon it, seized it, looked up into his
face, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! are you going to take me to Lady—right away—this
very, very minute?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as soon as I can wash my face, change my
coat and put on my hat,” said Amos Merritt, smiling
at the impetuosity of the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, please—oh, please! be very, very quick!
And I know you will be, for you always was possessed
of common sense!” exclaimed the child, with
her formula of highest praise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, thank you! I feel as if I were invested with
the Order of the Garter,” said the lawyer as he left
the office to retire into the little dressing-room where
he kept his best coat, clean collars, combs and
brushes, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>He spent but a few moments over his toilet, and
came out dressed for dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, now; I am ready,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by, dear little Owlet,” said Harcourt, stooping
to kiss the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!—but ain’t you going with us to see Lady?”
inquired the little one, with a look of surprise and
disappointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear child, I cannot do so,” sadly replied the
young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! but indeed, indeed, you must! you must! you
must!” she insisted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen to me, little one. My dear old mother is
sick in bed. I did not tell you so before, because I
did not wish to trouble you, but I tell you so now so
that you may know why I must hurry away to see
her,” said Harcourt, looking down into the earnest
face of the child, whose brown eyes were lifted to his,
full of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I am so sorry—so very sorry! I hope she will
get well soon, and then you can come to see Lady
and me,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“I should be very happy to do so, dear. Now you
will let me go? Good-by, dear,” he said, stooping
again to kiss her, and saying to himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is another final parting. Even this child I
shall never see after this day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merritt was drawing on his gloves, and kindliness
getting the better of his sternness for a moment,
he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t take leave of her here. Come along
with us. Our course goes the same way as far as
the avenue, where we take the up car, and you the
down one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; come as far with us as you can,” pleaded
Owlet, clinging to his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Willingly, my dear,” said the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three left the room together, Harcourt leading
the little girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the outer office Mr. Merritt stopped a moment
to speak to his clerk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not return here again, Lloyd. Lock up at
the usual hour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they went downstairs and left the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>On their way down Four and One-half Street to
Pennsylvania Avenue, Owlet chattered to her friend:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do thank you ever so much for being so good to
me. I shall be sure to tell Lady all about you, and
she will thank you, too, oh! ever so much! And so
will Ducky Darling, though she can’t say much, poor
little thing. She is so little, and so ignorant, you
know. And, oh! I hope your dear mother will soon
get well, and you will come to see me and Lady.
And you will fetch her, too, won’t you? I shall tell
Lady to write and ask her to come with you,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were very near the avenue, and they saw an
uptown car coming toward the crossing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merritt raised his stick and his voice to hail
and stop it. Then he took a hurried leave of the
young man, seized the child, and put her on the car
while she was still saying to her friend:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“Oh! good-by! good-by! good-by! I am so sorry you
are not going with us!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He raised his hat and smiled as the car ran away
with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he turned his steps in the opposite direction
and walked hurriedly to the railway station, arriving
there just in time to catch his train.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVII<br> <span class='c007'>ROMA AT WORK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After the abduction of Owlet and the departure
of Mr. Merritt the life of the lady of Goblin Hall was
very lonely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only one constant visitor cheered her solitude.
That was her aged pastor, Dr. Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Roma was inclined to grieve for her lost pet,
and cherish gloomy forebodings for the child’s future,
Dr. Shaw would always reassure her.</p>

<p class='c009'>One morning, when he was making a call, she said
to him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It fills me with despair to think of my little Owlet
in the power of that man—that man who deserted
his young wife and child when the child was but three
months old—that man who has no conscience and no
affection, who uses the child only as a scourge to
drive me into a position which I could not accept,
even for that dear child’s sake. I say it fills me with
despair, Dr. Shaw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Roma, as you cannot contest his claim to
his own child, as you cannot accept the terms upon
which he offers to restore her—as, in fact, you can
do nothing in this case, you must leave all in the
hands of Divine Providence. Hanson is an irreligious,
unprincipled man; yet, as he has more money than
he knows what to do with, he will take good care
of his own little daughter. You may assure yourself
of that.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>In this manner the good minister would seek to
raise her drooping spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'>One glorious forenoon, early in May, as Roma was
seated in her Quaker rocking-chair, on her front piazza,
engaged in her “contemplative knitting work,”
with the little colored child, Ducky Darling, seated
at her feet, nursing Owlet’s bull pup, George Thomas,
she heard the sound of wheels.</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking up, she saw a gig rolling along the acacia
drive toward the house. As it drew nearer she recognized
the venerable figure of the aged minister seated
within it, with another, of a young, grave, clerical-looking
man, beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Puck, who was hoeing a flower bed in front of the
house, dropped the hoe and ran forward to take the
horse’s head, just as the minister drew up the gig
before the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma also arose, and came down the steps to receive
the visitors, while Ducky Darling, with George
Thomas in her arms, waddled away, in fear of the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Shaw alighted, followed by his companion, and
threw the reins to the negro.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mus’ I take de hoss an’ gig ayound to de stable,
sah?” inquired Puck, touching his hat to the clergyman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; of course,” quickly struck in Roma, speaking
for her old pastor before he could open his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the negro mounted the gig and drove off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, my dear Roma,” said Dr. Shaw, offering
his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do? I am very glad to see you,” said
the young lady, cordially taking the proffered hand in
both of hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Allow me to introduce to you my esteemed young
friend, the Rev. Paul Stone. Mr. Stone, Miss Fronde.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young clergyman bowed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very happy to know you, Mr. Stone,” said
Roma, cordially offering her hand, which he took and
bowed over, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am honored.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>The hall door stood wide open on this lovely May
morning. Roma turned with a smile, and with a wave
of her hand mutely invited them to precede her into
the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, thank you. Let us sit out here, if you have
no objection; which, as we found you sitting here
when we drove up, I presume you have not,” said the
old minister, with a deprecating smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not. It is my favorite seat in this season,
always excepting the summer house in the garden,”
said Roma, with an answering smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Paul Stone drew chairs forward for Dr. Shaw and
himself, and they seated themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma resumed her own seat and her knitting work,
for she knew that nothing made her friends feel more
at ease than to see that they did not interrupt the
mechanical work that could be carried on without
interrupting conversation or withdrawing the least
attention from themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Stone graduated last summer from the Theological
College of Alexandria, Virginia. He was ordained
only this last Easter. Our parish is his first
charge,” said Dr. Shaw, with a smiling glance from
his hostess to his clerical brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma followed his glance, and noted the figure and
appearance of the young stranger. He was about
twenty-five years of age, tall, broad-shouldered, finely
formed, with regular features, dark complexion, black
eyes, black hair, and a cleanly shaven face. But his
greatest charm was in the expression of his countenance—grave,
sweet, intellectual, spiritual, suggesting
pictures of the young St. John, the beloved disciple.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very happy that you have come to our parish.
I thank you very much for coming,” said Roma
softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My gratitude is due to you, lady, for giving me the
opportunity to work,” he earnestly replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My young brother is going to be of the greatest
use to you in the organization of your Free School
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>for Colored People,” said Dr. Shaw, “and other good
works.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very sure that he will,” Miss Fronde replied,
not formally and conventionally, but most cordially
and emphatically.</p>

<p class='c009'>Paul Stone flushed and bent his head, saying modestly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall spare no pains to do my very best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Shaw then went into the subject of the free
school to be established on the Goeberlin estate for
the education of the colored people of that neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the first thing to be taken in hand,” he said,
“and one thing at a time is my maxim.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The three held counsel together on this subject, and
settled a part of the plan.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no building on the plantation that was
suitable, or that could be spared, so it was decided
to erect one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And there is no need to engage a contractor for
the simple building of a country schoolhouse. We
will employ local stone masons and carpenters, and
have a personal supervision over them,” said Dr.
Shaw, and he took his tablets and pencil from his
pocket and drew a design, which he submitted to
Roma and Paul Stone. Both approved, yet suggested
some little changes, which Dr. Shaw accepted as improvements
on his plan. Then the diagram was laid
aside for future consideration and their attention was
turned to the subject of teachers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both Dr. Shaw and Mr. Stone were in favor of
engaging male teachers, for they argued, and with
good reason, that, if besides children and young girls,
there were to be young men in the school, they would
require men to govern them.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Roma was opposed to the plan, and was in
favor of women, and here she was as firm as adamant.
She would try women and moral suasion first, before
resorting to men and corporal punishment—for that
was what men’s rule in such schools generally meant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>she thought. Moral suasion was so much holier an
influence than bodily fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear,” said the old parson, with an odd smile,
“‘the days of the years of my pilgrimage on earth’
are seventy-seven years and five months, and during
this long experience I have learned that all women
are not lambs, nor all men lions. I have known one
or two mistresses of plantations so cruel and tyrannical
that the lives of their slaves were hells upon
earth; and, on the other hand, I have known one or
two masters who ruled entirely through conscience
and affection; and one or two other people of each
sex who were utterly incapable of ruling in any manner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“These were exceptions, and the exception proves
the rule, it is said. I know that women have more
patience with children than men have, and these
young colored men and girls, whose docility you doubt,
are, in their ignorance, no more than children. Oh,
Dr. Shaw, don’t you know that all the little children
of our Lord are not under three feet tall? Some of
them are over six. But there is another reason why I
prefer to engage women for the school. There are so
few fields of labor free to women, while there is such
a vast area open to men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No doubt the old minister had an overwhelming
argument against this last “reason” in the fact that,
as a rule, women were not required to work in any
field of labor, but only in the lovely garden of home,
cultivating the flowers of the nursery and the fruits
of the dining-room, with a prospect of a harvest of
domestic happiness, while the men worked for them
in these outlying fields; but before he could utter his
thought they were interrupted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pontius Pilate ambled up to the house on his fat
white cob, dismounted, and brought the mail bag to
his mistress, pulled his front hair by way of obeisance,
and then remounted his horse and rode away to the
stable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma unlocked and emptied the bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were several papers and magazines, but only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>one letter. She offered the papers to her visitor, who
gladly received and unfolded them. Then she took
her letter. She recognized it at once—not by the
handwriting—there was no handwriting—it was written
by a typewriter, perhaps so that it might never
be brought in evidence against its author, though
Roma could not conjecture why that author thought it
necessary to take such a precaution.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her first impulse was to tear it up and throw it
away unread, but anxiety to hear from her loved and
lost little Owlet prevailed over her disgust, and she
opened and read it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a long, eloquent, impassioned appeal, which
we will not inflict upon our readers. It ended in
this wild sentence:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The child is dying—breaking her heart for you!
I am losing my reason—going mad for you! Oh,
Roma Fronde! what man ever worked, dared and suffered
for woman’s love as I have done for yours?
Send me a line; say that I may come to you and bring
the child, and save us both from death, and me from
hell!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Roma read the letter and passed it over to Dr.
Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took it, read it, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The child is with her father; her condition, no
doubt, exaggerated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And in any case, I cannot yield. Self-respect,
truth, womanhood, must not be sacrificed, even for a
beloved child. I must leave her to our Heavenly
Father,” said Roma, as she tore the letter to pieces
and threw the fragments away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Paul Stone, reading his newspaper, had paid no attention
to the low-toned conversation between his two
companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Dr. Shaw said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear, if you will be so good as to order
my gig, I think we will go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you won’t go! I sent the gig to the stable,
not to have it brought out until night. You and Mr.
Stone must really stay and spend the whole day, unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>there is some insuperable objection to your doing
so,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no such thing, my dear, but we really did
not come with any such intention, for we did not know
what your engagements might be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no engagements for the day—for any day, I
might add.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we shall be happy to stay. What do you
say, young brother? Shall we spend the day with
Miss Fronde, and go home by the light of the moon?—there
is a moon to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With all my heart,” said the young clergyman.
Then, turning to their hostess, he bowed, smiled, and
added: “I thank you, Miss Fronde.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You favor me, sir,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they stayed and spent the day, and went home
late in the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this day Roma Fronde’s busy life began.</p>

<p class='c009'>The site of the schoolhouse was chosen in a grove
on the borders of the estate nearest the village of
Goeberlin, and a number of workmen were employed
to get the stone from the quarries and to lay the basement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma, with her two advisers, Dr. Shaw and Mr.
Stone, soon perfected the plan for the superstructure,
and stone masons and carpenters were set to work.
Local mechanics were also employed to make the
desks and benches, pails, brooms, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was thought that the building might be completely
finished and furnished by the first of August,
but though the building could then be quite ready
for occupancy, Roma knew the school could not be
opened in the summer vacation time, or until, at earliest,
the first of September. She advertised for competent
teachers, who would be ready to enter upon
their duties at that date, and from a host of applicants
she selected one young and one middle-aged woman,
both unmarried.</p>

<p class='c009'>When these plans were all settled Roma decided to
leave their execution in the hands of her two clerical
friends and to go to Washington to begin her preparations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>for turning the Guyon Manor House, on the
Isle of Storms, into a free sanitorium for destitute
invalids and children. There was not so much to do
in that direction, but it needed to be done at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was another reason, also, why Roma wished
to get away from Goblin Hall as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Paul Stone, in his character of adviser and assistant
in the work of founding the free colored school,
had been an almost daily visitor at the hall. He had
been attracted and fascinated by the gracious and
majestic beauty of the person and character of Roma
Fronde. He loved, adored and worshiped her. He
was completely infatuated with her, and though he
never breathed the passion that was consuming him,
he constantly betrayed himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma’s kind heart was touched by his dumb devotion,
but now she found it difficult to be as gentle and
friendly in her manner to him as she wished to be,
without encouraging hope, and perhaps precipitating
a proposal from him, which she would be obliged to
meet with a rejection—a rejection painful to herself
and mortifying to him. She wished to avoid giving
him this humiliation. The only way out of the difficulty
that occurred to her mind was to leave the
neighborhood as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>So one morning, when Dr. Shaw called to see her,
she said to him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I shall go to Washington early next week?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed! Why so soon? Is this a sudden resolution,
my dear?” inquired the surprised rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, no. The work here is all well laid out, and
the schoolhouse will be finished and furnished even
before it is time to open the school. I can very well
leave the neighborhood now, and the supervision of
affairs here to you and Mr. Stone. I have very much
to do in Washington and at the Isle of Storms before
the first of August, when you and I must sail on our
voyage to Europe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have to make arrangements to convert the old
manor house on the Isle into a free sanitorium for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>the sick poor. Certainly there is not much to be done.
The house is large, and in good repair. I have only to
send down a great many cots, with bedclothes in proportion,
and provisions by the wholesale. This will
not take long to do, for it is quite as easy to buy a
hundred cots or twenty barrels of flour as to buy one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my dear, when we have the money, as you
have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I meant to say,” said Roma, with a slight flush,
“that it takes no more time to purchase a large quantity
than a small one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know what you meant, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So there is really not much to be done, though
what there is should be done immediately. If the
place is to be of any use this season it should be ready
for occupancy by the first of June.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. I see that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Therefore, I must go to Washington as soon as
possible. As you and Mr. Stone have been my invaluable
counselors and co-laborers in the work here, so
will Lawyer Merritt and Dr. Washburn be my advisers
and assistants in my work there. So that in the
course of four or five weeks I hope to get the free
sanitorium in good working order, with a resident
physician, a competent matron, and a staff of skilful
nurses and servants. Later you may safely leave the
parish and the school in the able hands of Mr. Stone,
and join me in Washington in time for our voyage.
How do you feel about that voyage, dear Dr. Shaw?”
Roma inquired, with interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like a schoolboy going on a holiday, my dear,” the
old minister exclaimed. “There are so many elements
of pure pleasure in it. We leave no family ties behind
to tear at our heartstrings, and we go to no
strangers, but to dear, old, lifelong friends. It will
be a glorious holiday, please the Lord!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had not come to stay this day, for he had other
and pressing engagements in his parish. So he soon
arose and bade Miss Fronde good-by.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Shaw’s gig had scarcely disappeared when a
peddler’s cart, driving leisurely up the avenue, came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>in sight. The peddler on the seat was no other than
Hanson’s disguised detective.</p>

<p class='c009'>Puck, as was his custom, ran from his work on the
lawn to take the horse’s head as the peddler stepped
down from his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish to see the lady of the house,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat’s her, den; dat’s our youn’ mist’ess a-sittin’ on
dat dere yockin-cha’ on de po’ch,” said Puck, as he
tied the horse to a tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man went up the steps, took off his hat, and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, ma’am; I have a fine assortment of
fancy and useful goods in my cart. May I have the
pleasure of showing them to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma was invariably kind to “all sorts and conditions”
of fellow creatures. In every man, woman and
child who approached her she recognized a neighbor.
No peddler, book agent, or even “lightning-rod man,”
was ever turned away empty handed. Each was trying
to make an honest living, and must be encouraged,
she said to herself and her friends. So to this peddler
she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. Perhaps I or my people would like to
buy something.” And she called Puck, and told him
to bring Nace, Hera and the children, and to find Pontius
Pilate and Ceres.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man ran off and summoned the whole
household, who soon crowded on the lawn in front of
the piazza.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, the peddler brought many paper boxes
from his cart and laid them on the floor. One, however,
he opened, and laid on a chair before Miss
Fronde. This was filled with fine laces, fichus and
pocket handkerchiefs, in smaller, separate boxes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Miss Fronde, “these are certainly very
pretty. I will take some of them. Now show my
people something that will please them—in bright
colors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The peddler bowed, and opened the larger boxes on
the floor, displaying gorgeous splendors in shawls,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>skirts, neckties, head handkerchiefs, aprons, gown
patterns and vest patterns, in red, yellow, blue, orange,
green, purple, or all blended, a spectacle that
almost took away the breath as well as dazzled the
eyes of the delighted darkies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now choose what you will as parting presents, for
I shall be going away in a day or two,” said Miss
Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the darkies thanked her in a tumultuous chorus
of delight, and took her at her word—largely at
her word—for they had boundless faith in their mistress’
fabulous wealth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hera chose prints and ginghams of the most brilliant
colors to make gowns and frocks for herself and
children, besides shawls and handkerchiefs of rainbow
hues. Pompous, Nace and Puck rivaled each
other in the fiery flames of red and yellow of the bandannas
and scarfs, neckties, gloves and vest patterns
of their selection.</p>

<p class='c009'>The children were decorated and delighted with imitation
coral and gilt beads, and dressed dolls and
gayly painted drums.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only Ceres groaned disapproval of the whole proceeding.
“It was all wanity an’ wexation ob de speerits,”
she said. “It was de scalirt ’oman at Babylon.
It was de beas’ wiv seven horns. An’ dey was all
gwine doun inter de bottomless pit ob de outer darkness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when urged to buy something she picked out
the darkest grays and browns and rustiest blacks she
could find in shawls and skirts and gown patterns for
her own lugubrious wearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma had a large bill to foot, but she paid it with
delight, seeing how happy she had made her people,
and believing how much she had helped the “poor”
peddler.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man’s load was considerably lightened when
he returned his half-emptied boxes to his cart, and,
after thanking the lady for her custom, mounted his
seat and drove off.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been peddling around the neighborhood for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>about ten days, and had been making cautious inquiries
about Goblin Hall and its mistress, or rather
skilfully leading gossips to talk, and had learned as
much as her neighbors knew of her life, and he had
reported the same to his employer. But this was the
first occasion on which he had visited Goblin Hall
and enjoyed the opportunity of a personal interview
with Miss Fronde. He had seen her under the most
favorable circumstances, when her whole personality
was irradiated with the delight of delighting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That lady,” he said to himself, “is not pining after
that child, or after anything else in this world. She
is the very happiest lady, as well as the handsomest
one, I ever saw in the whole course of my life. And
so generous! Why, if I had been a real peddler, my
fortune would have been made!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And these very words the detective also wrote to
his employer, tilling the heart of the latter with gall,
despair and bitterness.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the next day, Sunday, Roma went to church,
where the young assistant conducted the services and
the old pastor preached the sermon.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the benediction and the dispersion of the congregation
Roma took an affectionate leave of both
her clerical friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But as it will be nearly three months before you
sail for Europe, you will surely come down here once
again to see your friends before you go?” said Paul
Stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I shall,” said Roma gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But will you not promise to do so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I might; but I shall have so much to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young minister sighed profoundly. He did not
mean to betray his sorrow and despair, but he could
not help doing so.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be surprised, my dear, if you find us both
at the depot to see you off to-morrow morning,” said
Dr. Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do not break your rest so early. The train
leaves at seven,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>“Never mind. Only don’t be surprised,” repeated
the old rector as he handed her into her carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again she shook hands with both friends and then
drove home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br> <span class='c007'>ROMA IN WASHINGTON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Roma Fronde arose very early the next morning,
to be ready to secure her train. She spent but little
time over her breakfast and her leave taking, and a
little after five o’clock she entered her carriage, with
Puck on the box, and her traveling trunk strapped
behind, and started for Goeberlin station. After a
delightful morning drive up and down the wooded
hills that lay between the Hall and the village she
reached the railway depot and went into the waiting-room,
while Puck took her ticket, checked her baggage,
and dispatched a telegram that she had written
to Mr. Merritt to engage apartments for her at the
Wesleyan and meet her at the Washington depot on
the arrival of the latest train from the West.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the waiting-room she found Dr. Shaw and Paul
Stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you we should be here to see you off,” said
the elder man when both arose to shake hands with
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are so good to me always,” said Roma,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am so glad that you have so fine a day for your
journey, Miss Fronde,” ventured the younger man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you. It is a glorious day, is it not?” said
the young lady, still beaming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much too glorious to abandon the country for the
city.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but Washington is not like any other city in
the world, I think. Washington, with its broad, shaded
streets and avenues, its deeply shaded parks and
squares, is perfectly beautiful in May and June, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>the trees are in fresh leaf and the flowers in fresh
bloom—an ideal city,” said Roma with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I remember it when it was mostly bog, swamp and
scrubwood, and Pennsylvania Avenue was like a muddy
country road, with a few straggling houses and
shops built irregularly on each side,” said the old
minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, a beautiful city has now been evolved
from that ‘wilderness,’ and literally been made to
‘bloom and blossom as the rose,’” Roma replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment Tuck entered the waiting-room,
came up to his mistress, and handed her her ticket
and check.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be sure to take care of the carrier pigeons, Puck,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Deed will I, youn’ mist’ess, same as if dem birds
was my own chillun,” fervently replied the young
negro.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And poor little Owlet’s dog, Puck—don’t let any
harm come to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Needn’ tell me dat, youn’ mist’ess. Dat doag allers
sleeps wid de chillun. Ducky Darlin’ dotes on dat
doag; it’s de only comfo’t she takes ebber since de
po’ little lady was stole ’way; fo’ de po’ little lady’s
sake, I fink it is, ca’se she won’t answer to no udder
name but Ducky Darlin’, ca’se de little lady allers
called her dat; so we-dem has fell into de way ob it,
too. Oh, yes, youn’ mist’ess, dat doag gwine be well
tuk care ob, an’ likewise dem birds. Dere’s de train
comin’, youn’ mist’ess,” added the negro as the roar
of the approaching engine was heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, good-by, Puck. Don’t drive the horses fast
going back. They have had a hard drive here. And
if you should want to write to me, Dr. Shaw has
kindly promised to be your penman. Before the end
of the year I hope you will be able to read and write
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank ’e, youn’ mist’ess. All yight, youn’ mist’ess.
I’ll ’member all yer say,” said the negro.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma arose and took the proffered arm of Dr. Shaw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>to go out upon the platform, Mr. Stone following, and
Puck bringing up the rear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe this is the first journey you have ever
taken alone, my dear,” said Dr. Shaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no—not by many. When my dear father was
with General Lee I used always to go back and forth
between school and home alone. Of late years, it is
true, I have had companions, until now; but it is
nothing to take this journey alone. It will be a pleasant
summer day’s ride, through a very beautiful country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The train rushed, roaring and rattling, up to the
platform and stopped. Roma happened to be the only
passenger to get on at that station. Dr. Shaw put
her in her seat, and he and Paul Stone shook hands
with her. Puck pulled off his hat, bowed and grinned.
The railway porter rattled her trunk on the baggage
car. The engine gave a shrill whistle, and shot off,
dragging the train behind it.</p>

<p class='c009'>A long, pleasant summer day’s ride this really
proved to Roma Fronde, who was strong and healthy
enough to enjoy the rapid motion and the shifting
scenes for many hours without the least fatigue or
satiety.</p>

<p class='c009'>After sixteen hours’ run the train reached Washington,
at about eleven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma found Mr. Merritt waiting for her at the
depot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear. I
have a carriage waiting, and your rooms at the Wesleyan
Flats are engaged. Not your old rooms, because
Mrs. Brown and myself thought the associations
connected with them were, perhaps, too sad;
but rooms on the first floor front. There is hardly
anybody there at this season, so you may really have
your choice of apartments, if you should not like those
that have been made ready for you,” said Mr. Merritt,
after the first greetings were over and as he led her
out on the sidewalk, where a hack was waiting to receive
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You were very kind to take so much trouble on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>my account. I thank you very much,” said Roma as
he handed her into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, now, don’t hurt my feelings,” said the lawyer
with a laugh, as he paused at the carriage before
following her. “But tell me—how about your baggage?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I have only a trunk. I gave the check and
address to an expressman on the train, and the trunk
will be delivered to-morrow morning. It is too late
to-night, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Mr. Merritt, and he gave the order to
the coachman, “Wesleyan Flats,” and got in and seated
himself beside her.</p>

<p class='c009'>They bowled along Pennsylvania Avenue to Fourteenth
Street, and up that street to the northern terminus,
and then turned west, and drove until they
reached the new, tall, red-brick building named after
the great Methodist.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the hack drew up before the door Roma noticed
that lights were burning only in the hall and
in the first floor front. She went up the steps and
rang the bell while her old friend was taking out
her bag and wraps and telling the coachman to wait
for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Brown, the janitress, opened the door herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Miss Fronde! I am so glad to see you back
again,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you sat up for me. That was very kind,”
Roma replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is only half-past eleven. I am seldom in bed
before this time,” said the janitress as they all went
toward the elevator and entered it.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Pollyon Syphax was on duty there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is Titus?” inquired Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>Titus was the elevator boy who had been on duty
during Roma’s first sojourn in the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Titus? Oh, poor little fellow! the work, including
the late hours, was too much for him. He is in the
Children’s Hospital,” replied Mrs. Brown as the elevator
landed them all on the first floor, and she led
the way to Roma’s new apartments—front parlor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>bedroom and bathroom. The gas was lighted and the
windows hoisted, though the Venetian shutters were
closed, but let in the cool night air through the slats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope the child is not seriously ill?” Roma said
interrogatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no. He has been so, but now he is getting
well,” replied the janitress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will take him down to the Isle of Storms with
me,” was Roma’s thought as she sat down in an easy-chair
and took off her bonnet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, what shall I bring you to eat?” inquired Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing at this late hour. I had tea on the train.
Where is my old friend Tom?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he and his mother both left at the end of the
season. They are living in a one-room shanty in
the woods west of this, and she is washing, and her
boy fetches and carries the clothes backward and forward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will make them both happy by taking them back
to the Isle of Storms, to the old home they have been
pining for,” was Roma’s secret thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see,” said Mrs. Brown, “the house is nearly
empty at this season. The few permanent tenants
have their own servants, and cook their own meals.
The restaurant requires but one cook and one waiter.
Sarah Ann Syphax and her brother ’Pollyon fill these
places. My own son, George, runs the elevator at
present, but as he has gone to bed, ’Pollyon obligingly
undertook to do it to-night, his duties at the restaurant
being over for the evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merritt had seated himself in the big armchair,
and was debating in his own mind whether he should
tell Roma of the dispatch he had received that day
announcing the discovery of little Owlet in the streets
of New York. He decided not to do so that night,
lest the news should deprive Roma of sleep, so he got
up and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now, my dear, as I see you are safe under
Mrs. Brown’s wing, I will bid you good-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>“But you will come to-morrow morning?” said
Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fear not. I have a case in court that may occupy
me all day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then come and dine with me at seven in the evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With pleasure. Good-night, my dear. Get to bed
as soon as you can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, good friend. Sincere thanks for all
your kindness,” said Roma, holding out her hand. The
lawyer pressed it and went his way.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mrs. Brown, late as it was, was disinclined to
move. She was rather inclined for a gossip. Sinking
into the chair that Mr. Merritt had vacated, she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I really thought, when Mr. Merritt engaged these
rooms for you, that you were coming here on your
bridal tour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why should you have thought so?” demanded
Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because that gentleman who came here soon after
you left as good as told me that he and you were soon
to be married, and as good as promised to bring you
here on your bridal tour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What gentleman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Mr. William Hanson.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me all about his visit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, he came here to inquire after you. Somebody
had told him you were staying here. He said
he had been on a long voyage, and I think he said he
had been shipwrecked; in that way he had lost trace
of you. He asked me ever so many questions, and
made me tell him all about you—every single thing.
About your goodness to Madam Nouvellini and your
adoption of her orphan child, and your devotion to
the little one, and all; and he just as good as told me
how you was engaged to be married to him, and just
as good as pledged his word that he would bring you
here on your bridal tour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then he told you absolute falsehoods. I never was
engaged to the man, and never could have been so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“See that, now! Maybe you didn’t even know him?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“I used to know him—never as a friend, even, for
I could never have had the slightest confidence in his
honor or honesty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“See that, now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A clock not far off struck twelve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Miss Fronde, I won’t keep you up. Good-night,”
said the janitress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night,” replied Roma, and the elder woman
left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then that man did know that Owlet was his own
child,” she said. “No doubt, hearing of my attachment
to the little one, he came down to Goblin Hall
especially to make a bargain with me to the effect that
if I wished to keep my pet I must take him, too. But
as I absolutely refused to admit him, he watched his
opportunity, abducted the child, and wrote to me cautiously
from a distance. It is a wonder he did not
take her by a legal process. But, ah! I see. To do
that he would have been obliged to confess his marriage
with the ballet girl, and he knew that he could
safely abduct her and that I could do nothing. Oh,
my poor little Owl! Dr. Shaw may say what he
pleases, but I know that dandy devil, William Hanson,
is quite capable—not of killing the child, for he
is too much afraid of the penalty, but of doing worse
by her—of losing her, or throwing her away, as soon
as he finds that he cannot use her as a bait for me.
Poor little Owl!” Roma said to herself with a profound
sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently she arose and went into her comfortable
bedroom, undressed, and went to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her sixteen hours of continuous railway riding,
which might have fatigued a less robust woman “half
to death,” only prepared her to enjoy a luxurious repose;
and so, notwithstanding her uneasiness on little
Owlet’s account, she soon fell into a profound
sleep that lasted until late in the morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>She awoke at last from such a state of deep unconsciousness
that, on opening her eyes, she was surprised
to find herself in a strange, modern, elegantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>furnished chamber, instead of her old-fashioned bedroom
at Goblin Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, almost instantly, she remembered where she
was and what she had to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>She arose quickly, opened her windows, bathed and
dressed, and went to the elevator.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Brown’s son, George, a lad fourteen years old,
was on duty. She bade him good-morning, and went
all the way down to “Rebecca’s Well,” as the restaurant
in the basement was daintily called.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was late, and there was no one in the place except
the very tall, very gaunt and very black waiter
with the baleful name.</p>

<p class='c009'>She seated herself at one of the smaller tables and
touched the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Pollyon Syphax came to her at once. She ordered
breakfast, and was promptly served.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she asked the waiter if he could direct her to
the house occupied by Lucy and her boy Tom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yo’ can’t miss ob it, ma’am. It is yight in de bit
o’ woods lef’ back ob dis yere house,” he told her.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, as soon as she had finished her breakfast she
went upstairs to her room, put on her walking jacket,
hat and gloves, and went down and out to find her
colored friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had only to go to the corner of the building,
turn into an open brier and thistle-grown lot, and
cross it to the bit of wood at the back of the big
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>There, nestled among the trees, she saw the little
whitewashed shanty, with clotheslines full of newly
washed clothes hanging all around it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor souls!” Roma said to herself. “That is the
nearest approach to the country life they long for
to be found in the suburbs of the city; and how much
better is that little nest in the fragrant pine wood
than a room in a stifling tenement house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she walked toward the shanty, Lucy, in a red
turban and a blue gown, came out of the house with
a tub of clothes in her hands, and began to take them
out and hang them on the line.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>She was so intent upon her work that she did not
see Miss Fronde until that young lady came immediately
behind her and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do, Aunt Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who dat?” exclaimed the woman, with a start.
“Lor’ b’ess my po’ soul, young miss! I f’ought it was
a speerit as spoke, I did, fo’ a fac’! So yo’s com’d
back? ’Deed, I’s moughty proud to see yo’, honey.
Come in de house. Tom, he’s gone to ca’ay some clo’es
home; he’ll stan’ on his head w’en he years yo’ is
com’d back—’deed he will!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma followed the woman into the shanty, and
found the poorest, barest, but cleanest little nest that
ever two blackbirds found shelter in.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little bed in the corner, the big stove, with its
boiler, and the wooden bench with its washtub,
seemed to fill all the space.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma sat down on a three-legged stool, because
there was no better seat in the place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going down to the old house on the Isle of
Storms, Lucy. How would you and your boy like to
go with me?” inquired Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman stared at her so stupidly that Miss
Fronde repeated the question.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Lucy burst out suddenly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Miss Yoma! ’Ow would I like to go back to
dat b’essed ole p’ace? ’Ow would I like to go to hebben,
w’en my time come? Not as I’m in any huyey
to go dere, neider. I f’ought I was gwine to hebben
w’en I ’mancipated de ole p’ace an’ com’d yere. But,
Lor’!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so you would like to return, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like! W’y, youn’ mist’ess, I jeams ob it at night.
I jeams as I’m back dere in my log house, a-smokin’
ob my sweet corncob pipe by my b’ight pine-knot fire,
an’ I feels so happy, an’ finks as it is yeal, an’ dis
yere was de jeam. Den I wakes up, an’ sometimes I
cwies. It mos’ b’eaks my heart. It do, fo’ a fac’.
Sometimes Tom say to me, he say, ‘Mammy, w’at de
matter wid yo’?’ An’ I say, ‘Oh, Tom!’ I can say
no mo’n dat.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>“When can you be ready to go with me, Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any time—dis minit!—w’ich I doane mean zackly
dat, but soon’s ebber I finishes ob dem clo’es w’at’s
hangin’ on de line, w’ich will be dis werry arternoon,
’ca’se one mus’ keep deir ’gagements, yo’ know,
ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly,” assented Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I can be yeady to go to-night or moyer mo’nin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow morning will be quite time enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ I s’pose I kin take my furn’ture ’long ob me
in de boat, Miss Yoma?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Fronde looked around on the property in question,
pathetic in its utter poverty, and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, if you wish to take it; but when you
enter my service I will give you much better furniture
than this for your cottage on the Isle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All yight, den, youn’ mist’ess. I kin jus’ gib dese
yere fings to po’ Sa’a Ann Syphax, w’ich is a berry
po’ ’oman, w’ich I fink people as is well off an’ has
yich ladies fo’ fr’en’s, ’ad ought to be good to de po’.
Doane yo’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed. Now, good-by, Lucy. I have a great
deal to do to-day, and so I see have you. Tell Tom
to come to see me this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, won’t he, dough! Yopes wouldn’ hol’ him w’en
he know yo’ back!” exclaimed the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma did not return immediately to the Wesleyan,
but walked down to Fourteenth Street and took a
car, intending to go to the Children’s Hospital.</p>

<p class='c009'>On arriving at the building she asked to see Titus
Blair, and was shown to the convalescent ward, where
the boy was walking about, amusing himself with
some half dozen of his companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as he saw Miss Fronde his pale, thin face
lighted up with joy, and he came to meet her as fast
as his feeble limbs could fetch him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma took his hand, and made him sit down on
the bench that ran along the wall, and without referring
to his illness at all, she asked the orphan boy
where he was to go after leaving the hospital.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Titus said that he did not know. He supposed he
would go somewhere and sell papers or matches until
the first of December, when the busy season came,
and then he thought he would be taken on again at
the Wesleyan to run the elevator.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How would you like to go with me to my seaside
house for the summer?” Miss Fronde inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that would be so good!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you shall go with me. I will speak to the
house physician, and find out if you are fit to be discharged
in time to accompany me. Good-by, now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ de little miss, ma’am—is she well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Owlet was well when I saw her last,” replied Miss
Fronde evasively.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then she hurried away, to avoid answering
more direct questions about her lost pet.</p>

<p class='c009'>She went to the office of the house physician and
had an interview with him, in which she learned that
she might take the boy to the seaside as soon as she
should please to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the hospital Roma went to the office of her
father’s old friend, Dr. Washburn, but not finding
him, she sat down at his table and wrote a note, asking
him to call on her, if possible, during the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time Roma got back to her apartments at
the Wesleyan it was six o’clock, and time to dress for
her tête-à-tête dinner with Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>She ordered the table to be set in her private parlor,
and then went into her bedroom to make her
toilet.</p>

<p class='c009'>In twenty minutes, or less time, she came out,
dressed in a simple gray silk gown, with fine lace at
throat and wrists.</p>

<p class='c009'>As she entered the room at one door some one came
in at the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the next instant Owlet had flown like a bird
into her arms.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIX<br> <span class='c007'>ROMA AND HER ASPIRATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lady! Lady! Lady! Oh, Lady! Lady! Lady!”
cried Owlet, in a wild rapture of delight, as she clung
about the neck and bosom of her benefactress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Owlet! Why, Owlet! Darling! Mr. Merritt—what
does all this mean?” demanded Miss Fronde, in
supreme astonishment, as she returned the child’s caresses,
and raised her eyes to the lawyer’s amused
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had just entered after Owlet, and now stood
looking on the scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not want her to take you by surprise,” he
said. “I wanted to come in first, and tell you that
she had been found and brought back; but, heavens!
she darted past me and into your arms as soon as the
door was opened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lady! Lady! Lady! I saw you, and I couldn’t
help it! I couldn’t! I couldn’t! I couldn’t! I know
I’m not possessed of common sense now, but I don’t
care! I don’t care! so I’m possessed of you!” exclaimed
the child in an ecstasy of joy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When Owlet becomes calm you will perhaps explain
where she was found, how she came here, and
who brought her,” Roma said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Merritt nodded, and sat down.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not long, however, before the child’s transports
subsided, and she lay, quiet and contented, on
the bosom of her lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady, where is dear little Ducky Darling? Did
you bring her here with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my dear. I could not take her away from her
father and mother, you know,” Roma answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no; so you couldn’t. Are you going back soon,
Lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In about a month, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>“Then we will take Ducky Darling some dolls. She
likes dolls, if I don’t. Did she cry after me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew she would! Poor little Ducky Darling!”
said Owlet, and once more she subsided into silence,
with her head on Miss Fronde’s bosom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I too heavy for you, Lady? Do I tire you?”
she inquired at length.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, darling; not at all,” Miss Fronde replied, smiling
at the idea of herself being fatigued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do I bother you a bit, lying here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in the least.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you know it has been so long! so long! since
I saw you! So many, many years! years and years!
and years! I did think I would never see you no more!
Never no more! Never no more! Oh, Lady!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall never leave me again, my dear, if I can
possibly help it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That man who took me away was not possessed
of common sense. Now, was he, Lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid he had not that excuse for his wickedness;
but don’t think anything more about him, dear.
Try to compose yourself,” Miss Fronde said gently,
smoothing the brown curls away from the flushed little
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I will do everything you tell me,” said the
child, and with a sigh of infinite satisfaction she subsided
into quietude, and soon into sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma only waited to feel assured that the slumber
was too profound to be disturbed by movement, and
then she arose softly, carried the child into her own
chamber, laid her on the bed, loosened her clothes,
and left her fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she returned to the sitting-room, where she
found the lawyer still waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c009'>She sat down beside him and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, if you please, explain this affair to me, Mr.
Merritt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer gave her a “brief” of the case.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We already know by inference from the evidence
collected at Goeberlin, that the child was chloroformed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>when she was snatched away from Goblin
Hall. We also know that she was passed off, in her
insensibility, as a sick child, fast asleep, and that
Hanson took a small private compartment in the Pullman
car for himself and the child. All this we know
from what we heard from railway officials and others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But afterward—afterward!” said Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Afterward, from what could be gathered from the
child’s disjointed story, which, by the way, confirmed
the truth of all the foregoing collected from Goeberlin,
it seems that her abductor must have administered
some narcotic to her in her food at some way
station not far from Goeberlin. She must have slept
all the way from the neighborhood of Goeberlin to
New York City, for after she came to, after a long
illness—for it seems she really was very ill when that
fellow wrote to you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor child! Poor, weary dove!” sighed Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When she came to herself,” resumed the lawyer,
“after a dangerous illness, caused, no doubt, by the
effects of the horrible drugs that had been given her,
she had no sense of the time or space that had been
passed since her abduction. She thought she had
only been away a day or so, and that she was still
in the neighborhood of Goblin Hall, and her one longing
and one prayer was to be carried back to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My poor little Owlet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At last she ran away from her strange owner, and
went, like some poor, little, lost dog, to hunt its mistress
through the wide, wide world. But she thought
that Goblin Hall lay somewhere among the woods
and fields outside the city. She went, trying to find
her way out, until she wandered down somewhere—it
must have been in the neighborhood of the old Five
Points, for she fell into the hands of a thieving ragpicker,
who beguiled her into some den, stole her
clothes, wrapped her in an old rag of a shawl, took
her away in the dead of night, carried her some distance,
left her under a stoop, and deserted her.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>“Oh, heavens! How long ago was that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only two nights.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How was she found? Who rescued her? Who
brought her to Washington? Go on, please!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer paused for a moment and then answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“William Harcourt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“William Harcourt!” echoed Roma in boundless
amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” quietly replied Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How, in the name of heaven and all the angels,
could he have found her?” demanded Miss Fronde in
unabated wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was in New York at the time. He was coming
out of his lodging-house, in the gray of the morning,
on the day before yesterday, when he heard a moan
of distress near the steps. He followed the sound and
found the child. She was half dead with cold, hunger
and fright. He took her in, and with the assistance
of a poor seamstress, a fellow lodger in the
house, he succored her until she was able to give
some account of herself—just such a confused account
as a child of six years, who had been drugged,
first with chloroform and then with opium, and
brought three hundred miles in a state of stupor, had
had brain fever, and had come to her senses to find
herself in a strange city, among strangers, had run
away, had fallen among total thieves, had been left
to die under a stoop, and had been found half dead,
might be supposed to be able to give.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, the dastardly villain!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘There may be heaven!—there must be hell!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>exclaimed Miss Fronde, as the words of Browning
rushed into her mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the child’s imperfect story they heard such
names as ‘Roma,’ ‘Goblin Hall,’ ‘Dr. Shaw,’ and even
that of your humble servant. Of course, Harcourt
recognized these names at once, and he knew from
what place the child had been stolen, though he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>not know the name of the thief, nor the motive of
the theft; for those the child did not herself know,
and could not tell him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And did Will Harcourt send the child to Washington?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a moment. First of all, he wired me that
the child had been found. That was on the day before
yesterday. You were on your way from Goeberlin
Hall to Washington. I could not consult you; therefore,
I wired back that you could not interfere in the
case of the recovered child. I thought I would tell
you all about it when you should get to Washington,
but you arrived late, and I did not wish to tell you
any news that might keep you awake all night. I
deferred the announcement until this afternoon. In
the meantime, it seems Harcourt received a telegram
from Miss Wynthrop, summoning him immediately to
his mother’s sick bed. In his dilemma as to what he
should do with the forlorn child, he decided to bring
her with him, and even take her, if necessary, to Lone
Lodge. On his arrival in Washington he brought her
to my office, giving us, as it were, the refusal of her.
I thought, when I heard his statement, that under
the circumstances you might receive her, and having
this engagement to dine with you this evening, I ventured
to bring the child with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I will receive her, and of course I will
hereafter protect her against the unnatural monster
who deserted her to destitution in her helpless infancy,
and afterward stole her for blackmail and endangered
her life with his poisonous drugs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think that he will ever again disturb you
in the possession of the child. I do not think he will
dare to do it,” said Mr. Merritt earnestly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think he will. But why did not Will Harcourt
himself bring me the child?” Roma inquired, not
without some bitterness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, remember that he had to take the first
train west to fly to his mother’s sick bed. He had to
hurry on. He really had no alternative, Roma. Yet,
I will not deceive you. He told me that under no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>circumstances should he dare to present himself before
Miss Fronde,” said the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, heaven! Oh, my dear guardian, what can be
this hidden horror that parts my friend from me?”
demanded Miss Fronde, with a profound sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is no secret to me, I think, my dear. It is, of
course, his complicity in the matter of that fraudulent
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! no! no! no!” indignantly exclaimed the lady.
“It is some mental disturbance, superinduced upon
his brain fever, and of which Hanson, the fiend, took
advantage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fear that it is something more serious than mental
disturbance which we have hitherto supposed to
be the cause of his strange conduct. Since my interview
with him this afternoon I have been under the
impression that he is suffering from some deep remorse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remorse!—Will Harcourt!” Roma fairly gasped
for breath in her astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said that in a few days we should know all—or
words to that effect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma sighed deeply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But to change the subject, my dear, what are you
going to do with the child, now that you have so
much upon your hands?” inquired the lawyer, to divert
the lady’s mind from the sorrowful mystery of
William Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall keep her with me, wherever I may be; take
her with me, wherever I may go. She will be no hindrance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But when you go to Scotland?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall take her with me to Scotland; and, moreover,
in the interests of the orphan, I shall take her
to see that awful ancestress of hers, that Highland
chieftainess and Covenanter, Mistress Griselda Margaret
Arbuthnot, of Arbuthnot Kill, Cuthbert, Caithness.
There’s name, title and place for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment ’Pollyon Syphax entered the parlor
to lay the cloth for dinner, and by so doing stopped
the conversation for the time being.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>It was a tête-à-tête dinner, but as the waiter with
the baleful name was in attendance all the time there
could be no confidential communication between lawyer
and client.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dinner was scarcely over, and the table cleared off,
when Dr. Washburn was announced.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma arose to meet him with outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How good of you to come so promptly, dear doctor,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Fronde should know that I am always at her
orders, and happy to serve her,” replied the worthy,
old-fashioned gentleman, lifting the tips of her fingers
to his lips and bowing over them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he shook hands with Lawyer Merritt, who
was an old friend, and sank into the deep armchair
Miss Fronde had drawn forward for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>After some informal conversation Roma broached
the subject on which she wished to consult him, namely,
the organization of a sanitorium for the poor, on
the Isle of Storms.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor had by this time come to understand
the daughter of his old friend, Colonel Fronde, or to
think that he did, and in his private opinion he set
her down as a very eccentric woman, as well as a very
rich and beautiful one, who meant to live the life of
a philanthropic old maid, like that of the then Miss
Burdette Coutts. He knew perfectly well that it
would be utterly useless for any one to oppose her
in her projects, so he thought the best policy for him
to pursue, both in her interest and in that of those
whom she wished to benefit, would be to fall in with
her plans and give her the advantage of his advice
and assistance in all the details of the humane enterprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three friends sat down at a table together, with
pencils and tablets in hand, and talked “sanitorium”
all the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not be able to get off by the boat to-morrow
morning, Mr. Merritt. There is so much more to be
done here in the city than I had calculated upon that
I doubt very much whether I shall be able to go before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>next week,” said Miss Fronde as she closed her
well-filled notebook at the end of the conference.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The longer you may be detained here, Miss Fronde,
the better we shall all be pleased,” said Dr. Washburn,
striking into the conversation as he rose to take
leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both gentlemen bade the young lady a cordial good-night
and went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few minutes later there came a modest tap at
the door, and to Miss Fronde’s pleasant “Come in!”
Tom entered.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had a broad smile on his good-natured face. He
plucked his old hat off his head and bowed, and continued
to bow, and smiled, and continued to smile,
until Miss Fronde held out her hand and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do, Tom? Come here and shake hands
with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he shyly approached the gracious lady, and
took the hand she offered him, and showed his love
and honor in the best way he knew how, by slowly
swaying it up and down, smiling all the while in respectful
silence, until Miss Fronde gently withdrew
her fingers and inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How have you been since I saw you last, Tom?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Firs’ yate, mist’ess. Been fetchin’ an’ ca’in’ clo’es
back’a’ds an’ fo’a’ds fo’ mammy,” Tom answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he smiled a broader smile than ever, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soon’s ebber mammy tol’ me how yo’ was come
back yere I yunned yight ober yere to pay my ’bed’ence;
but Mr. ’Pollyon Syphax tol’ me how yo’ had
comp’ny, ma’am, so I didn’ like to ’trude; but I’s
moughty p’oud to see yo’, mist’ess, ’deed I is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Tom. How would you like to go to
the Isle of Storms with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d des like to go to de een’ ob de worl’ ’long o’
yo’, mist’ess; but I’d yudder go to dat ole p’ace wiv
yo’ dan to any yudder p’ace on dis yeth—I would, fo’
a fac’,” said Tom, almost tempted to turn a somersault
in his delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you shall go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is little Miss Cafferine, mist’ess?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>“She is well. She is with me here. She will go
with us to the Isle of Storms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! aine I g’ad! We shall all be so happy, mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope so. Now, Tom, as it is late, you had better
go home to your mother. She may be uneasy about
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, mist’ess, dat’s so. So mammy mought. Good-night,
mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, Tom.” The boy went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma passed into her chamber, and seeing her newly
recovered pet sleeping most sweetly and safely on
the outside of her bed, kneeled down by the side and
gave thanks to heaven for the restoration of the child.
Then she prayed for Will Harcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally she arose, and undressed the little slumberer,
so softly and deftly that the latter did not
wake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only as she laid her between the sheets Owlet murmured
in her dreams something about “Lady” and
“Ducky Darling,” and some one else who “was not
possessed of common sense.” Then almost instantly
she relapsed into sound sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma went to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Toward morning Owlet talked again in her sleep,
this time of “Mr. William” and of “Mrs. Annie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the gray of the dawn she half awoke, and spoke
to her bedfellow, calling her “Mrs. Annie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But when Miss Fronde replied, Owlet instantly remembered
where she was, and with a sigh of ineffable
content she sank into happy sleep again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXX<br> <span class='c007'>OWLET HARPS UPON HER ’VENTURES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the morning, when both awoke almost simultaneously
to a new sense of their reunion, the sun was
shining through their front windows.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>When they arose from bed, Roma would have begun
to wash and dress little Owlet, just from the impulse
of passionate affection, intensified by the startling
loss and sudden recovery of the child; but the changeling,
independent and self-reliant as ever, insisted
that she both could and would wash and dress her
“own self.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Which she did, making herself, in her cheap calico
frock and white apron, look like a rumpled pink and
white hollyhock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they went down by the elevator.</p>

<p class='c009'>George Brown, son of the janitress, was running it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s Titus?” inquired Owlet. “He wasn’t here
when Mr. Merritt brought me up in it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Titus, dear, has been sick in the hospital, but he is
getting well now,” Roma explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>The elevator touched the basement floor, and they
got out.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they entered the restaurant they found Tom
waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet left Miss Fronde’s side and made a dash at
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Tom! I am so glad to see you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So am I you, Miss Cafferine—moughty g’ad an’
moughty p’oud! But I doane lib yere now. No mo’
do mammy. She take in washin’, an’ I fetch an’ ca’y
out clo’es.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is it, then, that you are here this morning,
Tom?” gently inquired Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yo’ see, mist’ess, dey aine no clo’es to ca’y out
no mo’. Mammy say as how she aine got no mo’ call
to do no mo’ washin’, ’ca’se she’s gwine down to de
ole Sarpin’ to serve ’long ob yo’, mammy say. So I
ax mammy, mought I come ober yere to wait on yo’
table dis mornin’, an’ mammy say, ‘Yes, it is yo’ duty,’
mammy say. An’ den I yun ober yere an’ ax Mr. ’Pollyon
Syphax mought I wait on yo’ table, an’ den I
would help him wiv de udders for nuffin, ’ca’se I did
wan’ to wait on my own mist’ess and Miss Cafferine.
An’ Mr. ’Pollyon Syphax he say I mought, Mr. ’Pollyon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>did. An’ so yere I is,” said Tom, with a broad
grin of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Tom. It was very kind and thoughtful
of you to come,” said Miss Fronde, and her words
filled the boy’s heart to overflowing with delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he served with zeal and dispatch.</p>

<p class='c009'>After breakfast Roma took Owlet up to her room,
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear, the very first thing we have to do
this morning is to go down to Pennsylvania Avenue
and get you an outfit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet looked down at her common pink calico frock
and white apron critically, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. This was pretty. I liked it very much when
Mrs. Annie first gave it to me, but now it is all rumpled
up, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think so,” said Roma, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you see, I wore it all day Monday, and rode
in it all day yesterday, and went to sleep in it on
the cars, and tumbled about in it on the cushions, I
reckon, so now my frock is a sight to behold. Oh!
isn’t it, though?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, dear. Cover it with your little coat.
That is very decent,” said Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. You see, woolen things don’t rumple like calico,
do they, now?” said Owlet as she drew on the little
brown coat and carefully buttoned it up before.</p>

<p class='c009'>She next put on her little brown hat and gloves,
and was ready to go out by the time Miss Fronde got
on her own walking jacket, hat and gloves.</p>

<p class='c009'>They went down together, and out upon the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you like to go and see where Aunt Lucy
and Tom live?” Roma asked as they left the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, wouldn’t I though!” Owlet exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then; we will go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They turned around the corner, scrambled though
the bramble lot, and reached the piece of woods in
which Lucy’s bird nest stood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! ain’t it just like a chicken coop?” merrily demanded
Owlet.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>“Something of the sort,” assented Roma.</p>

<p class='c009'>They entered the cabin, and found Lucy mending
old clothes, and Tom, who had returned from the
restaurant, was actually helping her, with needle,
thread and thimble.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as Tom saw the visitors he sneaked his
work behind his back, with all a boy’s false shame at
being caught at woman’s work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mornin’ youn’ mist’ess. Hopes I sees yo’ well,
ma’am,” said Lucy, rising and placing two three-legged
chairs for her visitors. “How do, Miss Cafferine?
Yo’ doane look as peart as yo’ used to did. Been
sick?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Owlet as she seated herself on a very
low stool beside Miss Fronde’s rather larger one. “I
should think I had been sick. And I have been away
from Lady so long—years and years and years. And
I have had ’ventures. Not stories, mind you, like
Jack the Giant Killer, and that, because that’s nonsense;
but real, bloody-minded ’ventures. No wonder
I look bad. Wonder my hair isn’t turned gray. I
should have been dead and gone by this time if Mr.
William hadn’t found me and fetched me back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lucy, with eyes and mouth both wide open, turned
from the child to the lady, and inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot de yittle fing mean, youn’ mist’ess?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was stolen from me while we were at Goblin
Hall, and she has been very ill. But she was brought
back to me, safe and well, last night. We will not
talk any more about it at present, Lucy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All yight, youn’ mist’ess, ef yo’ say so, we won’t.
But, oh, the williany ob some people on dis yeth! Ef
eber I cotch my eye on dat lowlife trash, whoeber
it was wot don’ it—umph-humphe!—dere’ll be a foot
yace or a fun’al. Now min’!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Lucy, I only come to let Catherine see your
little house, and now we must go. Good-by,” said
Miss Fronde, rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by, youn’ mist’ess. Me an’ Tom’ll be ready
to go ’long ob yo’ any time now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not go before next week; but in the meantime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>you may want to make purchases before you go.
Take this on account, for you and him,” said Miss
Fronde, and she put a twenty-dollar note in Lucy’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! thanky, youn’ mist’ess! Thanky, ma’am! Lor’!
dis is twice mo’ money’n ebber I had ’fo’ in all de
days ob my pilg’imidge,” said Lucy, courtesying between
every sentence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I gwine to come to wait on yo’ at dinner time,
mist’ess. I gwine to come wait on yo’ table ebbery
time w’ile yo’ stay inter dat house. Mr. ’Pollyon Syphax
say how I may. Mr. ’Pollyon Syphax moughty
’bligin’ colored gemman, Mr. ’Pollyon Syphax am,”
said Tom, smiling in delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I fink ’Pollyon Syphax mought be ’bligin’
on such ’casions. Yo’ doin’ his work fo’ him, an’ me
a gibbin’ Sa’ Ann Syphax my own house, wot me an’
yo’ knock togedder wiv our own han’s out’n de ole
camp lumber, an’ all de stools an’ de fings as we made
ourse’ves! An’ all a f’ee gif’! I des yeckon how ’Pollyon
Syphax mought be ’bligin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma left Lucy holding forth on the Syphax indebtedness,
and with a smiling nod turned away from
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>She led Owlet back across the bramble lot and down
the street to the northern starting point of the Fourteenth
Street cars, found one empty, and got into it
with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>They rode all the way down to the southern terminus,
corner of F Street, where they got out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roma, leading her protégée, walked across to the
avenue, and down it to a well-known emporium of
ready-made clothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>They entered this establishment, which was a perfect
treasury of necessary, useful and beautiful articles
of wearing apparel for women and children of all
ages and conditions.</p>

<p class='c009'>It required but a short time to select from such
stores a sufficient outfit for the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having ordered her purchases to be sent to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>address, Roma took Owlet to the Children’s Hospital,
to see Titus Blair.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lad was quite overjoyed to see so soon again
the lady who had promised to take him to the seaside,
and with her the little playmate whom he had known
at the Wesleyan Flats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She used to ride up and down in the elevator with
me a great many times a day, ma’am. It was almost
the onliest amoosement she had, afore yo’ took her in
han’, poor little thing!” Titus explained, looking fondly
at the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” said Miss Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet seated herself beside the invalid boy, and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Titus, I have got such lots and lots and lots to
tell you! Not such stories like Cinderella, because
them’s all lies, you know; but real, awful ’ventures
with a wicked man, who was not possessed of a grain
of common sense, and stole children away and made
them go dead! Yes, and about horrid old women who
smell enough to knock you down, and tell you such
lies! Oh! I’ve got lots of ’ventures to tell you, Titus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy stared first at the child and then at the
lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Titus,” she said, “little Catherine was stolen
from Goblin Hall, but you see we have got her back,
safe and well. Now do not let us talk about it any
more to-day. It is not good for either of you. The
doctor says you can go to the seaside any time with
me now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! can I, ma’am? Oh! won’t that be just glorious!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope it will do you good. I expect to leave on
next Saturday. Have you clothes enough, my boy?
Or have you lost them during your illness?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have some underclo’es here, ma’am, an’ this suit
wot I’m a-wearin’ ob now; an’ I’ve got a Sunday suit
in my ole garret loft at the Vesleyan, ma’am,” said
the boy, with some pride in his poor wardrobe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know you had very nice clothes when you
ran the elevator. You were always very neat.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>“Had to be, ma’am, an’ it took ’mos’ all my wages
fo’ to keep me so; but ef I hadn’t been I’d ’a’ lost my
place, sure as a gun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you any money left, my boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just a dollar ’n eighty cents, ma’am, an’ I’m thinkin’
as I ought to pay that to the hospital, ma’am. It
aine much to offer ’em fo’ all dey don’ fo’ me, but it’s
ev’ry cen’ I have, an’ I think I ought ter offer it ter
’em. What do yo’ think, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you are quite right, and you might offer
it to the hospital,” said Miss Fronde, who was much
too wise to discourage a boy in his impulse of justice
or generosity, from any mistaken kindness to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Brown has got it keepin’ fo’ me. Will yo’
please ask her to send it ter me, so I kin give it ter
’em?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly; and I will send it over by Tom this
afternoon,” Roma replied. Then, wishing to test the
boy further, she inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you pay all your savings away, Titus, what will
you do when you get well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go to work, ma’am. An’ I should do that anyways,
whether I had any tin or no,” promptly replied
the lad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But perhaps you might not be able to get work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I should, ma’am. I never was out’n it till
I got sick. Ef I can’t get one sort o’ work I can get
anudder. Yo’ see, ma’am, I can turn my han’ to ’mos’
anythin’ in the way o’ plain, hard work,” said the lad,
with sublime self-reliance, and with unconscious heroism.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh-h-h! Ain’t he possessed of common sense!” exclaimed
Owlet in a rapture of admiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I quite agree with you, my little owl,” said Roma
as she arose to take leave of the boy, repeating her
promise to send Tom with his money in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanky, ma’am. I’ll be awful glad to see old Tom!
I haven’t seen him since I have been in de hospital. I
reckon Tom was too bashful to come an’ see me,
’mong so many strangers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very likely; but he will be glad to come when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>has the excuse of being sent on an errand,” said Miss
Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Roma left the hospital she spoke to both
nurse and doctor, telling them that as she had permission
to do so, she should take Titus Blair away
on some evening, so as to have him ready to go with
her party the next week.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they reached Miss Fronde’s apartments at
the Wesleyan they found that Owlet’s new outfit had
arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owlet dressed herself in a seal-brown cashmere
frock, trimmed with satin of the same color, and went
down with her lady to dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>They found Tom there, waiting to serve them.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the dishes of the first course had been placed
upon the table Roma said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tom, I wish to send you on an errand this afternoon,
to take something to Titus Blair, at the Children’s
Hospital.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All yight, mist’ess,” said the boy, with a bow. “I’ll
be yeady to go ’mediately arter dinner. I be moughty
p’oud to go see po’ Titus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Half an hour later Roma got the sick boy’s little
purse from Mrs. Brown and gave it to Tom to take to
its owner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may tell Titus that you are going to the Isle
of Storms with us, Tom. I forgot to do so,” said Miss
Fronde.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, mist’ess, I doane like to do dat,” replied the
boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ca’se it make po’ sick Titus feel so bad ’ca’se he
can’t go, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Titus is going with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lor’, mist’ess! yo’ doane say so? Oh, aine I
glad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Now run away, or it will be too late for you
to get admission to the hospital.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom only waited until he reached the sidewalk before
he turned a somersault for joy, stood on his head,
and kicked, toppled over, picked himself up, and ran,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>leaping and dancing, to the corner of Fourteenth
Street, to take the car for the Children’s Hospital.</p>

<p class='c009'>That afternoon Roma found her first opportunity
of questioning Owlet. She heard every detail of her
abduction from Goblin Hall, her journey, and her sojourn
in New York, that the child knew, and, much
more than any one else, had been able to draw from
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>All Miss Fronde’s worst suspicions were confirmed,
and she resolved to defend little Owlet against Hanson,
even if she should have to do so in the courts
of justice, as the child’s “best friend.” She also emphasized
her resolution to take the orphan to Scotland
with her, and to bring her, if possible, to the
acquaintance of that austere ancestress of whom poor
Marguerite Nouvellini had spoken with so much awe.
She had written three letters to that great lady, but
had received no answers.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the remainder of that week Roma spent in making
her purchases and other preparations for the sanitorium;
in doing all of which she was advised and
assisted by Dr. Washburn.</p>

<p class='c009'>By Tuesday evening all these goods had been
packed and shipped on board the <i>John Gordon</i>, bound
from the port of Georgetown to Norfolk and New
York, and taking in the Isle of Storms, with other
points, in its course.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had also engaged passage for herself and
friends on the same comfortable little boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The events of the voyage will be chronicled in the
third and last of this series, under the title of “<span class='sc'>To
His Fate</span>,” published in cloth binding, uniform with
this volume.</p>

    <div><span class='xlarge'>Good Fiction Worth Reading.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A series of romances containing several of the old favorites in the field
of historical fiction, replete with powerful romances of love and diplomacy
that excel in thrilling and absorbing interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE. A story of American Colonial Times. By
Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>A book that appeals to Americans as a vivid picture of Revolutionary
scenes. The story is a strong one, a thrilling one. It causes the true
American to flush with excitement, to devour chapter after chapter, until
the eyes smart, and it fairly smokes with patriotism. The love story is a
singularly charming idyl.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE TOWER OF LONDON. A Historical Romance of the Times of Lady
Jane Grey and Mary Tudor. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with
four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>This romance of the “Tower of London” depicts the Tower as palace,
prison and fortress, with many historical associations. The era is the
middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c012'>The story is divided into two parts, one dealing with Lady Jane Grey,
and the other with Mary Tudor as Queen, introducing other notable characters
of the era. Throughout the story holds the interest of the reader
in the midst of intrigue and conspiracy, extending considerably over a
half a century.</p>

<p class='c009'>IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING. A Romance of the American Revolution.
By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Hotchkiss has etched in burning words a story of Yankee bravery,
and true love that thrills from beginning to end, with the spirit of the
Revolution. The heart beats quickly, and we feel ourselves taking a
part in the exciting scenes described. His whole story is so absorbing
that you will sit up far into the night to finish it. As a love romance
it is charming.</p>

<p class='c009'>GARTHOWEN. A story of a Welsh Homestead. By Allen Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is a little idyl of humble life and enduring love, laid bare before
us, very real and pure, which in its telling shows us some strong points of
Welsh character—the pride, the hasty temper, the quick dying out of wrath....
We call this a well-written story, interesting alike through its
romance and its glimpses into another life than ours. A delightful and
clever picture of Welsh village life. The result is excellent.”—Detroit Free
Press.</p>

<p class='c009'>MIFANWY. The story of a Welsh Singer. By Allan Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is a love story, simple, tender and pretty as one would care to
read. The action throughout is brisk and pleasing; the characters, it is apparent
at once, are as true to life as though the author had known them
all personally. Simple in all its situations, the story is worked up in that
touching and quaint strain which never grows wearisome, no matter how
often the lights and shadows of love are introduced. It rings true, and
does not tax the imagination.”—Boston Herald.</p>

<p class='c009'>DARNLEY. A Romance of the times of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey.
By G.P.R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>In point of publication, “Darnley” is that work by Mr. James which
follows “Richelieu,” and, if rumor can be credited, it was owing to the advice
and insistence of our own Washington Irving that we are indebted
primarily for the story, the young author questioning whether he could
properly paint the difference in the characters of the two great cardinals.
And it is not surprising that James should have hesitated; he had been
eminently successful in giving to the world the portrait of Richelieu as a
man, and by attempting a similar task with Wolsey as the theme, was
much like tempting fortune. Irving insisted that “Darnley” came naturally
in sequence, and this opinion being supported by Sir Walter Scott,
the author set about the work.</p>

<p class='c012'>As a historical romance “Darnley” is a book that can be taken up
pleasurably again and again, for there is about it that subtle charm which
those who are strangers to the works of G. P. R. James have claimed was
only to be imparted by Dumas.</p>

<p class='c012'>If there was nothing more about the work to attract especial attention,
the account of the meeting of the kings on the historic “field of the cloth of
gold” would entitle the story to the most favorable consideration of every
reader.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is really but little pure romance in this story, for the author has
taken care to imagine love passages only between those whom history has
credited with having entertained the tender passion one for another, and
he succeeds in making such lovers as all the world must love.</p>

<p class='c009'>CAPTAIN BRAND, OF THE SCHOONER CENTIPEDE. By Lieut.
Henry A. Wise, U.S.N. (Harry Gringo). Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>The re-publication of this story will please those lovers of sea yarns
who delight in so much of the salty flavor of the ocean as can come through
the medium of a printed page, for never has a story of the sea and those
“who go down in ships” been written by one more familiar with the scenes
depicted.</p>

<p class='c012'>The one book of this gifted author which is best remembered, and which
will be read with pleasure for many years to come, is “Captain Brand,”
who, as the author states on his title page, was a “pirate of eminence in
the West Indies.” As a sea story pure and simple, “Captain Brand” has
never been excelled and as a story of piratical life, told without the usual
embellishments of blood and thunder, it has no equal.</p>

<p class='c009'>NICK OF THE WOODS. A story of the Early Settlers of Kentucky. By
Robert Montgomery Bird. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>This most popular novel and thrilling story of early frontier life in
Kentucky was originally published in the year 1837. The novel, long out of
print, had in its day a phenomenal sale, for its realistic presentation of
Indian and frontier life in the early days of settlement in the South, narrated
in the tale with all the art of a practiced writer. A very charming
love romance runs through the story. This new and tasteful edition of
“Nick of the Woods” will be certain to make many new admirers for
this enchanting story from Dr. Bird’s clever and versatile pen.</p>

<p class='c009'>GUY FAWKES, A Romance of the Gunpowder Treason, By Wm. Harrison
Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “Gunpowder Plot” was a modest attempt to blow up Parliament,
the King and his Counsellors. James of Scotland, then King of England,
was weak-minded and extravagant. He hit upon the efficient scheme of
extorting money from the people by imposing taxes on the Catholics. In
their natural resentment to this extortion, a handful of bold spirits concluded
to overthrow the government. Finally the plotters were arrested,
and the King put to torture Guy Fawkes and the other prisoners with
royal vigor. A very intense love story runs through the entire romance.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER. A Romance of the Early Settlers in the
Ohio Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth. 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>A book rather out of the ordinary is this “Spirit of the Border.” The
main thread of the story has to do with the work of the Moravian missionaries
in the Ohio Valley. Incidentally the reader is given details of the
frontier life of those hardy pioneers who broke the wilderness for the planting
of this great nation. Chief among these, as a matter of course, is
Lewis Wetzel, one of the most peculiar, and at the same time the most
admirable of all the brave men who spent their lives battling with the
savage foe, that others might dwell in comparative security.</p>

<p class='c012'>Details of the establishment and destruction of the Moravian “Village
of Peace” are given at some length, and with minute description. The
efforts to Christianize the Indians are described as they never have been
before, and the author has depicted the characters of the leaders of the
several Indian tribes with great care, which of itself will be of interest to
the student.</p>

<p class='c012'>By no means least among the charms of the story are the vivid word-pictures
of the thrilling adventures, and the intense paintings of the beauties
of nature, as seen in the almost unbroken forests.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is the spirit of the frontier which is described, and one can by it,
perhaps, the better understand why men, and women, too, willingly braved
every privation and danger that the westward progress of the star of empire
might be the more certain and rapid. A love story, simple and tender,
runs through the book.</p>

<p class='c009'>RICHELIEU. A tale of France in the reign of King Louis XIII. By G. P.
R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1829 Mr. James published his first romance, “Richelieu,” and was
recognized at once as one of the masters of the craft.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this book he laid the story during those later days of the great cardinal’s
life, when his power was beginning to wane, but while it was
yet sufficiently strong to permit now and then of volcanic outbursts which
overwhelmed foes and carried friends to the topmost wave of prosperity.
One of the most striking portions of the story is that of Cinq Mar’s conspiracy;
the method of conducting criminal cases; and the political trickery
resorted to by royal favorites, affording a better insight into the statecraft
of that day than can be had even by an exhaustive study of history.
It is a powerful romance of love and diplomacy, and in point of thrilling
and absorbing interest has never been excelled.</p>

<p class='c009'>WINDSOR CASTLE. A Historical Romance of the Reign of Henry VIII.,
Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth
12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Windsor Castle” is the story of Henry VIII., Catharine, and Anne
Boleyn. “Bluff King Hal,” although a well-loved monarch, was none too
good a one in many ways. Of all his selfishness and unwarrantable acts,
none was more discreditable than his divorce from Catharine, and his marriage
to the beautiful Anne Boleyn. The King’s love was as brief as it
was vehement. Jane Seymour, waiting maid on the Queen, attracted him,
and Anne Boleyn was forced to the block to make room for her successor.
This romance is one of extreme interest to all readers.</p>

<p class='c009'>HORSESHOE ROBINSON. A tale of the Tory Ascendency in South Carolina
in 1780. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J.
Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c012'>Among the old favorites in the field of what is known as historical fiction,
there are none which appeal to a larger number of Americans than
Horseshoe Robinson, and this because it is the only story which depicts
with fidelity to the facts the heroic efforts of the colonists in South Carolina
to defend their homes against the brutal oppression of the British
under such leaders as Cornwallis and Tarleton.</p>

<p class='c012'>The reader is charmed with the story of love which forms the thread
of the tale, and then impressed with the wealth of detail concerning those
times. The picture of the manifold sufferings of the people, is never overdrawn,
but painted faithfully and honestly by one who spared neither
time nor labor in his efforts to present in this charming love story all that
price in blood and tears which the Carolinians paid as their share in the
winning of the republic.</p>

<p class='c012'>Take it all in all, “Horseshoe Robinson” is a work which should be
found on every book shelf, not only because it is a most entertaining
story, but because of the wealth of valuable information concerning the
colonists which it contains. That it has been brought out once more, well
illustrated, is something which will give pleasure to thousands who have
long desired an opportunity to read the story again, and to the many who
have tried vainly in these latter days to procure a copy that they might
read it for the first time.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE PEARL OF ORR’S ISLAND. A story of the Coast of Maine. By
Harriet Beecher Stowe. Cloth, 12mo. Illustrated. Price, $1.00</p>

<p class='c012'>Written prior to 1862, the “Pearl of Orr’s Island” is ever new: a body
filled with delicate fancies, such as seemingly array themselves anew each
time one reads them. One sees the “sea like an unbroken mirror all
around the pine-girt, lonely shores of Orr’s Island,” and straightway
comes “the heavy, hollow moan of the surf on the beach, like the wild
angry howl of some savage animal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Who can read of the beginning of that sweet life, named Mara, which
came into this world under the very shadow of the Death angel’s wings,
without having an intense desire to know how the premature bud blossomed?
Again and again one lingers over the descriptions of the character
of that baby boy Moses, who came through the tempest, amid the
angry billows, pillowed on his dead mother’s breast.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is no more faithful portrayal of New England life than that
Which Mrs. Stowe gives in “The Pearl of Orr’s Island.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
